99	FileCleaner thread never ends and cause memory leak in ASFileCleaner opens a thread and Theno solution is given to the user to end it  So when an application is undeployed in an Application Server  a thread is still alive  The WebApp can t be undeployed and this results in a classloader leak that will cause an OutOfMemoryError  I think the API should be extended so that a user can end the thread  A better way would be to provide a class that cleans everything for commons IO
136	HexDump s use of static StringBuffers isn t thread safe  HexDump has two private static dump   method s that alter static instances of StringBuffer  dump long  modifies static StringBuffer variable _lbuffer returning _lbuffer dump char  modifies static StringBuffer variable _cbuffer returning _cbuffer Both these methods are called by the public static dump byte    long  OutputStream  int  method  Multiple threads calling the public dump method at the same time could cause these StringBuffer to contain mixed up data and result in a bug
201	CountingInputStream CountingOutputStream only partially synchronized  CountingInputStream is only partially synchronized  The count is not synchronized when it is updated in read operations  so is not guaranteed to be published correctly  The synchronization could be removed without loss of functionality  Not sure it makes sense to share a stream between threads anyway  as the underlying stream is unlikely to be thread safe  If only one thread reads the stream  then the count field could be made volatile  This would allow other threads to read the count safely
207	Race condition in forceMkdir  If two processes or threads call forceMkdir   with the same directory there is a chance that one will throw an IOException even though a directory was correctly created  by the other process or thread
216	Delete files quietly when an exception is thrown during initialization  LockableFileWriter fails to report lock file deletion failure   it calls lockFile delete   several times but fails to check the return code  N B  IIRC  file delete   returns false if there was no file to delete  so any fix needs to take this into account
