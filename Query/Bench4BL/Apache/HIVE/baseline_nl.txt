545	Use ArrayList instead of Vector in single threaded  Hive codeMost of the Hive code is single threaded  but sometimes we are using Vector instead of the more efficient ArrayList  See http   java sun com j2se 1 5 0 docs api java util ArrayList html  This class  ArrayList  is roughly equivalent to Vector  except that it is unsynchronized

3408	A race condition is caused within QueryPlan classHive s threads are stopped at HashMap getEntry     that is used within QueryPlan extractCounters   and QueryPlan updateCountersInQueryPlan    It seems that a race condition problem of a HashSet object is caused when extractCounters   and updateCountersInQueryPlan   are concurrently executed  I hit the problem with Hive 0 7 1 but  I think that it also is caused with 0 8 1  The problem is reported by several persons on mailing list  http   mail archives apache org mod_mbox hive dev 201201 mbox  3CCAKTRiE 3x31FDy 3F0c jZSXQrhxBgT4DOyfZddm7sdX cu Zg mail gmail com 3E http   mail archives apache org mod_mbox hive user 201202 mbox  3CFC28CCD9 9C75 4F8D B272 3D50F663A634 gmail com 3E The following is a part of my thread dump    Thread 1091  prio 10 tid 0x00007fd17112b000 nid 0x1100 runnable  0x00007fd175f60000  java lang Thread State  RUNNABLE  Thread 1090  prio 10 tid 0x00007fd17012f000 nid 0x10ff runnable  0x00007fd175152000  java lang Thread State  RUNNABLE

7341	Support for Table replication across HCatalog instances  The HCatClient currently doesn t provide very much support for replicating HCatTable definitions between 2 HCatalog Server  i e  Hive metastore  instances  Systems similar to Apache Falcon might find the need to replicate partition data between 2 clusters  and keep the HCatalog metadata in sync between the two  This poses a couple of problems   The definition of the source table might change  in column schema  I O formats  record formats  serde parameters  etc    The system will need a way to diff 2 tables and update the target metastore with the changes  E g   targetTable resolve  sourceTable  targetTable diff sourceTable      hcatClient updateTableSchema dbName  tableName  targetTable    The current HCatClient addPartitions   API requires that the partition s schema be derived from the table s schema  thereby requiring that the table schema be resolved before partitions with the new schema are added to the table  This is problematic  because it introduces race conditions when 2 partitions with differing column schemas  e g  right after a schema change  are copied in parallel  This can be avoided if each HCatAddPartitionDesc kept track of the partition s schema  in flight  The source and target metastores might be running different incompatible versions of Hive   The impending patch attempts to address these concerns  with some caveats    HCatTable now has  a diff   method  to compare against another HCatTable instance  a resolve diff  method to copy over specified table attributes from another HCatTable  a serialize deserialize mechanism  via HCatClient serializeTable   and HCatClient deserializeTable     so that HCatTable instances constructed in other class loaders may be used for comparison    HCatPartition now provides finer grained control over a Partition s column schema  StorageDescriptor settings  etc  This allows partitions to be copied completely from source  with the ability to override specific properties if required  e g  location   HCatClient updateTableSchema   can now update the entire table definition  not just the column schema  I ve cleaned up and removed most of the redundancy between the HCatTable  HCatCreateTableDesc and HCatCreateTableDesc Builder  The prior API failed to separate the table attributes from the add table operation s attributes  By providing fluent interfaces in HCatTable  and composing an HCatTable instance in HCatCreateTableDesc  the interfaces are cleaner ish   The old setters are deprecated  in favour of those in HCatTable  Likewise  HCatPartition and HCatAddPartitionDesc   I ll post a patch for trunk shortly

synchronized void sourceStateUpdated String sourceName       eventually calls  public synchronized boolean isInWaitQueue        The latter returns the boolean  so it definitely doesn t need synchronized  however I don t know if there are other similar issues and what is necessary inside sync blocks  perhaps there s a better fix  Overall I d say synch methods on objects that call any other non trivial objects should not be used  Perhaps for now it would be good to replace all sync methods by sync blocks that cover entire method  as well as remove the unnecessary ones like the isWait    one  Then the scope of the blocks can be adjusted based on logic in future

13395	Lost Update problem in ACIDACID users can run into Lost Update problem  In Hive 1 2  Driver recordValidTxns    which records the snapshot to use for the query  is called in Driver compile    Now suppose to concurrent  update T set x   x   1  are executed    for simplicity assume there is exactly 1 row in T  What can happen is that both compile at the same time  more precisely before acquireLocksAndOpenTxn   in runInternal   is called  and thus will lock in the same snapshot  say the value of x   7 in this snapshot  Now 1 will get the lock on the row  the second will block  Now 1  makes x   8 and commits  Now 2 proceeds and makes x   8 again since in it s snapshot x is still 7  This specific issue is solved in Hive 1 3 2 0  HIVE 11077 which is a large patch that deals with multi statement txns  by moving recordValidTxns   after locks are acquired which reduces the likelihood of this but doesn t eliminate the problem   Even in 1 3 version of the code  you could have the same issue   Assume the same 2 queries  Both start a txn  say txnid 9 and 10   Say 10 gets the lock first  9 blocks  10 updates the row  so x   8  and thus ReaderKey currentTransactionId 10  10 commits  Now 9 can proceed and it will get a snapshot that includes 10  i e  it will see x   8 and it will write x   9  but it will set ReaderKey currentTransactionId   9   Thus when merge logic runs  it will see x   8 is the later version of this row  i e  lost update  The problem is that locks alone are insufficient for MVCC architecture   At lower level Row ID has  originalTransactionId  rowid  bucket id  currentTransactionId  and since on update delete we do a table scan  we could check that we are about to write a row with currentTransactionId &lt   currentTransactionId of row we ve read  and fail the query   Currently  currentTransactionId is not surfaced at higher level where this check can be made  This would not work  efficiently  longer term where we want to support fast update on user defined PK vis streaming ingest  Also  this would not work with multi statement txns since in that case we d lock in the snapshot at the start of the txn  but then 2nd  3rd etc queries would use the same snapshot and the locks for these queries would be acquired after the snapshot is locked in so this would be the same situation as pre HIVE 11077   A more robust solution  commonly used with MVCC  is to keep track of start and commit time  logical counter  or each transaction to detect if two txns overlap   The 2nd part is to keep track of write set  i e  which data  rows  partitions  whatever appropriate level of granularity is  were modified by any txn and if 2 txns overlap in time and wrote the same element  abort later one   This is called first committer wins rule   This requires a MS DB schema change It would be most convenient to use the same sequence for txnId  start and commit time  in which case txnid start time    In this case we d need to add 1 filed to TXNS table   The complication here is that we ll be using elements of the sequence faster and they are used as part of file name of delta and base dir and currently limited to 7 digits which can be exceeded   So this would require some thought to handling upgrade migration  Also  write set tracking requires either additional metastore table or keeping info in HIVE_LOCKS around longer with new state   In the short term  on SQL side of things we could  in auto commit mode only  acquire the locks first and then open the txn AND update these locks with txn id  This implies another Thrift change to pass in lockId to openTxn  The same would not work for Streaming API since it opens several txns at once and then acquires locks for each   Not sure if that s is an issue or not since Streaming only does Insert   Either way this feels hacky   Here is one simple example why we need Write Set tracking for multi statement txns Consider transactions T 1 and T 2  T 1  r 1 x   &gt  w 1 y   &gt  c 1 T 2  w 2 x   &gt  w 2 y   &gt  c 2 Suppose the order of operations is r 1 x  w 2 x      then a conventional R W lock manager w o MVCSS will block the write from T 2 With MVCC we don t want readers to interfere with writers and so the following schedule is possible  because Hive s semi shared  write  don t conflict with shared  read  locks  in Hive s current implementation  r 1 x  w 2 x  w 2 y  c 2 w 1 y  c 1 By the time w 1 y  happens  T 2 has committed and released it s locks   But this is a lost update if c 1 is allowed to commit   That s where write set tracking comes in
13458	Heartbeater doesn&apos t fail query when heartbeat fails  When a heartbeat fails to locate a lock  it should fail the current query  That doesn t happen  which is a bug  Another thing is  we need to make sure stopHeartbeat really stops the heartbeat  i e  no additional heartbeat will be sent  since that will break the assumption and cause the query to fail

13725	ACID  Streaming API should synchronize calls when multiple threads use the same endpointCurrently  the streaming endpoint creates a metastore client which gets used for RPC  The client itself is not internally thread safe  Therefore  the API methods should provide the relevant synchronization so that the methods can be called from different threads  A sample use case is as follows  1  Thread 1 creates a streaming endpoint and opens a txn batch  2  Thread 2 heartbeats the txn batch  With the current impl  this can result in an  out of sequence response   since the response of the calls in thread1 might end up going to thread2 and vice versa
13753	Make metastore client thread safe in DbTxnManager  The fact that multiple threads sharing the same metastore client which is used for RPC to Thrift is not thread safe  Race condition can happen when one sees  out of sequence response  error message from Thrift server  That means the response from the Thrift server is for a different request  by a different thread   Solution will be to synchronize methods from the client side
13833	Add an initial delay when starting the heartbeat  Since the scheduling of heartbeat happens immediately after lock acquisition  it s unnecessary to send heartbeat at the time when locks is acquired  Add an initial delay to skip this
13858	LLAP  A preempted task can end up waiting on completeInitialization  if some part of the executing code suppressed the interruptAn interrupt along with a HiveProcessor abort call is made when attempting to preempt a task  In this specific case  the task was in the middle of HDFS IO   which  handled  the interrupt by retrying  As a result the interrupt status on the thread was reset   so instead of skipping the future get in completeInitialization   the task ended up blocking there  End result   a single executor slot permanently blocked in LLAP  Depending on what else is running   this can cause a cluster level deadlock

14739	Replace runnables directly added to runtime shutdown hooks to avoid deadlock  Deepesh Khandelwal reported that a deadlock can occur when running queries through hive cli  Chris Nauroth analyzed it and reported that hive adds shutdown hooks directly to java Runtime which may execute in non deterministic order causing deadlocks with hadoop s shutdown hooks  In one case  hadoop shutdown locked FileSystem Cache and FileSystem close whereas hive shutdown hook locked FileSystem close and FileSystem Cache order causing a deadlock  Hive and Hadoop has ShutdownHookManager that runs the shutdown hooks in deterministic order based on priority  We should use that to avoid deadlock throughout the code
14778	document threading model of Streaming APIThe model is not obvious and needs to be documented properly  A StreamingConnection internally maintains 2 MetaStoreClient objects  each has 1 Thrift client for actual RPC   Let s call them  primary  and  heartbeat   Each TransactionBatch created from a given StreamingConnection  gets a reference to both of these MetaStoreClients  So the model is that there is at most 1 outstanding  not closed  TransactionBatch for any given StreamingConnection and for any given TransactionBatch there can be at most 2 threads accessing it concurrently  1 thread calling TransactionBatch heartbeat    and nothing else  and the other calling all other methods
