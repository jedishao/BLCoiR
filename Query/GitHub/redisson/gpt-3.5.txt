1626	RedissonLock deadlock issue in JCache implementation using bucket4j with AWS ElastiCache Redis 3.2.4 Redisson 3.5.4 3.8.0 caused by the watchdog thread continuously renewing the lock lease indefinitely resulting in threads waiting forever for the lock. The unlock method can also fail leaving the watchdog thread holding the lock indefinitely. Expected behavior includes the use of a lease time with an atomic check at update time a configurable lock timeout. Issues can be verified via Redisson code review can be reproduced by forcing a Redis timeout on the unlock call.
