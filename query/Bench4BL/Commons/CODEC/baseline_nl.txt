96	Base64 encode   method is no longer thread safe  breaking clients using it as a shared BinaryEncoder  Streaming support was added to Base64 in commons codec 1 4 with CODEC 69  This introduced instance variables to Base64 which means the class can no longer be used as a shared BinaryEncoder instance  For example  BinaryEncoder has an interface which could be  and was  used like this with Base64     class Example    private BinaryEncoder encoder   new Base64       byte   someMethod byte   data     try    return encoder encode data       catch  EncoderException e     throw new RuntimeException e               Base64 is no longer thread safe in commons codec 1 4  so code like the above which is accessed by multiple threads can throw NullPointerException   java lang NullPointerException    at      application code     Looking at the implementation of Base64  I think making it thread safe for this kind of usage would be quite tricky  I haven t attempted to prepare a patch  I would be happy if it was indicated in the Javadoc that Base64 is not thread safe and should not be shared  However  some other users of commons codec might be more worried about this regression
