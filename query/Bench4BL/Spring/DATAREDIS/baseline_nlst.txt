310	Lock of RedisCache is not safeRedisCache get lock only in clear   method  RedisCache checks clear   s lock in the other methods  but inconsistencies may occur due to race conditions  put   method is serious because there is a serialize process  For example    1  Thread A put method  check lock  2  Thread A start serialize value  3  Thread B clear method  check lock  4  Thread B get lock  5  Thread A put key and value  6  Thread B start del keys  7  Thread B del key from Thread A I think it is better to get lock in all methods get put evict   Or serialize value before call connection multi    and deserialize value after call connection exec
