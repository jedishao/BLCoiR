291322	Test errors when running JDT Core tests on Windows 7  Some tests randomly cause exceptions on tear down when running on Windows 7  This is caused by a known Windows issue that a lock on a file might not get freed immediately and hence subsequent calls to e g  delete the file fails  Pattern is to retry several times
327143	IndexManager should not accept new jobs if the processing thread is null  I ran into a case where a simulateExit   was called and the next touch     call failed  The consequence was that the simulateRestart   was never called  But a new jar file added ended up being added into the waiting jobs and the index manager was in an infinite loop and the number of awaiting jobs was always 1 and since the processing thread was null  that job was never run  So we must make sure that the index manager doesn t accept new jobs if the processing thread is null or if stops the loop when there is an awaiting job but the thread is null  Right now the loop never ends unless the number of awaiting jobs is 0
421473	Delayed assignment of declaring scope for arguments creates a race condition  BETA_JAVA8  Staring at LocalVariableBinding getAnnotations    I see that there is a potential race condition there  The setting of declaringScope happens far away from the creation of LVB and if there are calls in between to getAnnotations    we can t retrieve it from the annotation holder since this requires a handle to enclosing source type which is obtainable only from a scope  To circumvent this  there is a block of code in this method that manufactures an array of annotation bindings and returns it without going to the holder  However  this is problematic since with Java 8 some of the annotations could actually be type annotations which should be detached from the parameters  This block of code itself cannot filter the type annotations because there are clients that need to see all the annotations to transfer the type annotations to type  I think the solution is to set the declaring scope eagerly  At least for arguments  I don t know what side effects ensue for doing this for all locals  Patch will follow shortly
431275	Deadlock in JavaModelManager PerProjectInfo and DeltaProcessingState  An adopter product  IBM  than runs in headless mode is hitting a deadlock with monitors org eclipse jdt internal core JavaModelManager PerProjectInfo and org eclipse jdt internal core DeltaProcessingState  This product started to hit this deadlock with JDT 3 6 50 v_B79_R36x_J7  org eclipse jdt core_3 6 50

show_bug cgi id 338006 was put into the stream between those two versions  although the bugzilla was targeted to 3 7  maybe was backported   and the code added there appears in all the stack traces I have collected  specifically  the call to the new method DeltaProcessor addPackageFragmentRoot in DeltaProcessor addToParentInfo   BTW  I compared the code with the latest code in master  and the code path involved in these stacks has not changed  so I believe this could happen in master as well  Below are the stack traces  Thread Name Worker 2 State Deadlock Blocked Monitor Owns Monitor Lock on
