DigestAuthenticator: nonceCountValid() fails in case of simultaneous asynchronous requests of the same client.
Concerned components:
org.apache.catalina.authenticator.DigestAuthenticator
org.apache.catalina.authenticator.DigestAuthenticator.NonceInfo
Scenario:
A multithreaded client sends two requests within one millisecond.
The DigestAuthenticator creates for each request a nonce as well as a NonceInfo instance.
The two nonces are equal, as they were created within the same millisecond.
When writing data into the cache (method generateNonce()), the second NonceInfo instance overwrites the first one (same key!).
Problem:
The two client threads then send a second request with a digest authentication header.
In both requests, nc? (nonce count) is equal 1?, as the nonce has been newly created.
In the NonceInfo of the first request, array seen? is set to true? for index ((nonceCount + offset) % seen.length).
In the second request the same NonceInfo instance is used, as the instance is retrieved from map  nonces? using nonce? as a key, that is, in both requests the same key is used.
Consequently, method nonceCountValid() returns false, as  seen[(nonceCount + offset) % seen.length)] has already been set to true.
Therefore the authentication fails, although the client has sent a valid digest authentication header.
Conclusion:
Working with multi-threaded clients with many requests, digest authentication does not function reliably.
