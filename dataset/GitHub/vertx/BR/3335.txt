FileSystemImpl.existsInternal can block event loop thread
Version
3.8.5
Context
Invoking vertx.filesystem().exists() can block the event loop thread. This is because resolveFile() runs in the event loop thread instead of in the worker thread:
See https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/blob/master/src/main/java/io/vertx/core/file/impl/FileSystemImpl.java#L1113:
  private BlockingAction<Boolean> existsInternal(String path) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(path);
    return new BlockingAction<Boolean>() {
      File file = vertx.resolveFile(path);
      public Boolean perform() {
        return file.exists();
      }
    };
  }

resolveFile should instead be called in the perform() method:
  private BlockingAction<Boolean> existsInternal(String path) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(path);
    return new BlockingAction<Boolean>() {
      public Boolean perform() {
        File file = vertx.resolveFile(path);
        return file.exists();
      }
    };
  }

Do you have a reproducer?
You can mock calls to resolveFile() to sleep for any amount of time or set a breakpoint on the resolveFile call as a test runs. Wait up to the blocked thread checker interval and unpause execution. BlockedThreadChecker will report that the thread has been blocked.
Steps to reproduce
See above.
