HttpClientMetrics#createEndpoint may be called multiple times for the same endpoint
The implementation of io.vertx.core.http.impl.ConnectionManager.QueueManager#getConnQueue can lead to HttpClientMetrics#createEndpoint being called multiple times for the same endpoint if different threads try to use a fresh HTTP client:
      ConnQueue connQueue = queueMap.get(address);
      if (connQueue == null) {
        connQueue = new ConnQueue(version, this, address);
        ConnQueue prev = queueMap.putIfAbsent(address, connQueue);
        if (prev != null) {
          connQueue = prev;
        }
      }
      return connQueue;
HttpClientMetrics#createEndpoint is called from the ConnQueue constructor so a single instance of ConnQueue must be created if none is in the map.
Otherwise SPI implementations my leak resources acquired in #createEndpoint as #closeEndpoint would never be called for the corresponding queue instance.
