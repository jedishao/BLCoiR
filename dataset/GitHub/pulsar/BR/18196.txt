What did you expect to see?
    public CompletableFuture<Void> removeOwnership(NamespaceBundle bundle) {
        ResourceLock<NamespaceEphemeralData> lock = locallyAcquiredLocks.get(bundle);
        if (lock == null) {
            // We don't own the specified bundle anymore
            return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(null);
        }

        return lock.release();
    }

should be locallyAcquiredLocks.remove(bundle)
What did you see instead?
