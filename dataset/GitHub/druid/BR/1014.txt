real time node lead to wrong result(empty result) for the request with regexp filter when real time node is ingesting kafka msg.
increase the kafka message send speed gradually, real time query result will be wrong for the request with regex filter.
request is:
"filter": {
    "type": "regex",
    "dimension": "sub5",
    "pattern": "B"
}
...
"orderBy": {
    "type": "default",
    "columns": [
        {
            "dimension": "clicks",
            "direction": "DESCENDING"
        }
    ],
    "limit": 3
}

result is:
[ {
"version" : "v1",
"timestamp" : "2015-01-06T05:37:00.000Z",
"event" : {
"clicks" : 28
}
}, {
"version" : "v1",
"timestamp" : "2015-01-06T05:37:00.000Z",
"event" : {
"clicks" : 3,
"sub5" : "BB1"
}
}
...
]
Note, I did not send empty value for the dimension I queried. But result show one null value for the sub5 dimension.
query later, the empty result disappear. It seems thread race condition leads to this error.
If not solve the problem, druid will not be really real time system.
both tested on 0.6.121.1 and 0.6.160
