SimpleELContext is not thread-safe.
Class SimpleELContext extends javax.el.Context. 
Javadoc http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/2.1/docs/jsp-2_1-pfd2/javax/el/ELContext.html said:
"""" Because it stores state during expression evaluation, an ELContext object is not thread-safe """.
Instance of SimpleELContext is stored in ELDelegatingPropertyResolver and ELDelegatingVariableResolver, which are application singletons, so this instance of SimpleELContext is shared for all sessions.
This bug is very strange, because in single user development/testing everything works fine, but in production with more users, we got usually NullPointerException on bizzarre places in program like this :
&gt;        String label = getItemLabel() != null ? getItemLabel().toString() : null;
Attachment contains a patch, which helps me.
