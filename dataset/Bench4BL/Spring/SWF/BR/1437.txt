Two concurrent threads in an expression of a flow override the rootobject of evaluation contextWhen two concurrent threads are evaluating an expression contained in a flow, the evaluation context linked to the expression can be overriden by multiple threads.
Result is in most of cases NullPointerException in a getValueInternal of classes from  org.springframework.expression.spel.ast package (like PropertyOrFieldReference for example).
Wrong code seems to be in org.springframework.binding.expression.spel.SpringELExpression :
	public Object getValue(Object rootObject) throws EvaluationException {
		try {
			updateEvaluationContext(rootObject);
			return expression.getValue(evaluationContext, expectedType);
...
As the SpringElExpression is unique for the expression to be evaluated, it's not thread safe when updating the evaluation context with root object.
Synchronize this method resolves problem.
