StepSynchronizationManager uses static HashMap - NullPointerException with multiple Threadsorg.springframework.batch.core.scope.context.StepSynchronizationManager produces NullPointerException, because it uses static java.util.HashMap to increment and decrement variables for the current Thread, which is not threadsafe.
Solution: Replacing java.util.HashMap with java.util.Hashtable (threadsafe) works for me.
Also see this build error https://build.springsource.org/browse/BATCH-TRUNK-JOB1-6375/test/case/62852213;jsessionid=59A64053379861A4C2328C879E4525EA with the same exception.
Find attached a minimal maven project (start TestStepSynchronizationManagerMain to reproduce the NullPointerException) and a possible fix.
