DefaultJobParametersConverter is not thread-safe and the SimpleJobOperator either DefaultJobParametersConverter is not thread-safe due to usage of instance variable for numberFormat, dateFormat and longNumberFormat. 
Then as the SimpleJobOperator use a JobParametersConverter as a instance variable it is not thread-safe either. 
Thus means that we cannot use it with a SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor or any asynchronous TaskExecutor. 
Can you fix it or can you explain which setup as be evaluated to make it work properly with an asynchronous TaskExecutor?
