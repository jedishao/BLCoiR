SecurityContextHolder JavaDoc errorFrom acegisecurity-developer:
Javadoc for org.acegisecurity.context.SecurityContextHolder: "Associates a given SecurityContext with the current execution thread and any new threads the current execution thread may spawn." 
It can confuse users, as I know InheritableThreadLocal no longer used in SecurityContextHolder, so SecurityContext will not be associated with new threads which current execution thread may spawn.
