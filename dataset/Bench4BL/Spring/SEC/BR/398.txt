HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter/AuthenticationProcessingFilter thread concurrency issue.
On a successful authentication I occassionally get redirected back to the login page rather than the requested protected resource. 
This is due to a thread concurrency issue.
C: GET /protected/resource
S: 302 Redirect to /login
C: GET /login
S: 200 OK
C: POST /j_acegi_security_check  // THREAD-1 (successful login)
S: 302 Redirect to /protected/resource // THREAD-1
 THREAD-1 not finished yet (not reached HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter post doFilter() block, which means SecurityContext has not been updated with successfull authentication).
C: GET /protected/resource // THREAD-2
S: 302 Redirect to /login // THREAD-2
...
 THREAD-1 completes request and SecurityContext is updated.
Solution:
Delay the redirects using a response wrapper until after the HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter has updated the SecurityContext.
