Class AbstractJaxbMessageConverter is not thread safe.
JAXB marshallers and unmarshallers are not thread safe (http://jaxb.java.net/guide/Performance_and_thread_safety.html) and should be created separately in each thread. 
The class AbstractJaxbMessageConverter incorrectly caches the marshaller and unmarshaller which may cause ArrayIndexOutofBoundsExceptions amongst others.
