            <title>[SPR-10166] Clean Install on Clean Windows OS - Absolute Minimum Path - Does Not Work</title>
                <link>https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-10166</link>
                <project id="10000" key="SPR">Spring Framework</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;1. Brand New Computer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Install JDK 1.6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Install Spring 3.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. On first Startup - multiple error message windows;&lt;br/&gt;
a - EGIT - Do I know if this matters? How the eff should I know. A massive error dialog shows up about EGit. It&apos;s one of many possible SCM utilities - why - I wonder - why - is there any error about this one lone, latest not-so-greatest SCM utility on a clean install.&lt;br/&gt;
b - cant remember and don&apos;t care anymore&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Create, through Spring MVC template, a project. Immediately have 15 project errors. Do they matter - how the hell should I know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. New Tack - Click link to Spring MVC demo project. 35 errors right away. Do they matter - how the hell should I know. 35 errors * 6000 solution = a whole lot of pain&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is why, after 100K of education costs, and 20 years total time invested in education, with 15 years IT experience in IT industry, I HATE I.T. and just cant take it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I can&apos;t take a brand new computer, do nothing other than follow the &apos;Get Started&apos; link at SpringSource, and create a non-error filled default app based on a template, or install a non-error filled demo app, what can I say about the &apos;value&apos; of Spring vs San Fran Framework from 1997 (that started this all), or J2EE - or it&apos;s many successors or immatators?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me ask you - do you honestly believe that this crap is even marginally better than San Fran from 16 years ago? Because the marketing material directly next to the &apos;Get Started This Is All You Need&apos; link, in addition to the documentation and other materials available, seem to imply so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what has changed in the past 15 years - the words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I would like to apologize for your bad experience on getting started. This should definitely not happen and I hate it myself when those things happen. Since this is a very common use case scenario that we always keep an eye on, I would like to find out what went wrong in your case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess you are referring to the Spring Tool Suite 3.1 in your description above (the Eclipse-based tooling that you downloaded and used).&lt;br/&gt;
Regarding 4.) on what operating system are you running on? And was it a 32bit or a 64bit one (including the JDK)?&lt;br/&gt;
Regarding 5. and 6.) are you working behind a proxy?  It sounds a lot like STS wasn&apos;t able to download/access the Maven dependencies of those projects that you tried (MVC template and the MVC showcase) and a proxy network could have caused this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be very happy to hear more details about your problems/issues to avoid those issues for future releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot in advance!!!&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok - I was able to replicate this issue on a clean build on two different laptops. One running windows 7 and the other running windows 8. Same behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to get around the mvc-showcase issue by using git to download the project, rather than clicking the link under the STS dashboard examples section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So - I&apos;ve replicated this issue on multiple machines with two different OS. But - I am now on a different network, and none of these issues occur.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="86756" author="mlippert" created="Mon, 14 Jan 2013 13:27:49 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks for getting back to this with more details. The fact that you are now on a different network and none of the mentioned issues occur anymore indicates indeed a problem for Maven downloading the dependencies. I guess the other network was guarded by a proxy. If that is indeed the case, Maven requires you to define the proxy settings in the settings.xml file: &lt;a href=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And do I understand you correctly that you was able to get around the issues by downloading the project using git directly while being on that network that didn&apos;t work? How did you import the projects into your workspace? &quot;Import as existing Maven project&quot;? If my guess is correct and the problem is related to Maven not being able to download the artifacts, then I wonder how this would change using git... Hmmm... Can you maybe check the proxy idea on the non-working network? That would be great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no problem regarding the language, I understand your frustration.&lt;br/&gt;

                            <comment id="86769" author="hoffit" created="Mon, 14 Jan 2013 19:05:44 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m currently in a Spring course and will not have access to my network again until Friday. I will try and replicate the problem again then and get back to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me summarize the issues now that I have a little more perspective;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Clean install STS 3.1 for eclipse 4.2 with 64 bit JDK v 1.6. Windows 7 and 8 machines. Personal home network&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Issue 1 - Click to download samples from STS dashboard. Result - some number of build errors. Note - the resulting project does not appear in the workspace as a spring project, and as a side affect, cannot be drag-dropped on to the app server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issue 2 - Create new project from Spring MVC template. Result - 34 compile errors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workaround for issue 1 - Use the git perspective to manually check out and create a maven project. Works straight away, and can be dropped onto the server and executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally - neither issue occurs on the wifi network at my spring training providers network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that my home network is nothing special - just a standard setup through a major service provider. I have 8 networked devices (computers, phones, media devices, xboxs). There are no issues with any of these devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question - any special port used when trying to resolve resource dependencies that might be blocked by the router at home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="86896" author="mlippert" created="Thu, 17 Jan 2013 10:17:07 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Hey David!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No special ports being used by Maven while resolving dependencies, as far as I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue gets more mysterious... So checking out the project from git and importing it as a Maven project into STS sounds like STS (or the Maven Integration for Eclipse) was able to download and resolve dependencies in that case. But why doesn&apos;t that happen when you click on the Dashboard? That is strange, especially since you were on your home network when doing this, so no proxy servers or corporate firewall involved. Hmmm...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know once you are back on your home network so that we can hopefully figure out what is going wrong there. In case we find a good time slot, we could even do a screen sharing session to solve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;br/&gt;

                            <comment id="87045" author="hoffit" created="Sat, 19 Jan 2013 12:21:20 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there is a timeout on the download of jar files that I am running into and that error message gets swallowed? I was able to create a simple spring integration project (one time it failed with a missing jar and one time it worked). My home network is a bit slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that I was creating Spring MVC projects before - perhaps there are large jar files for that template?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m getting another from-the-factory laptop late next week and will try some more iterations then. Will post additional comments if I get issues while developing/building until that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priority/Sev should be lowered for now.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="87049" author="mlippert" created="Sun, 20 Jan 2013 05:28:44 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;When the template project is used for the first time, the project itself is downloaded (but that is a relatively small ZIP file). But in addition to that Maven tries to download all the dependencies from Maven servers - and that could be quite some amount of libs. Once they are downloaded and put into the local Maven repo, they are not downloaded again when you use the same template project again. And those dependencies seem to be the root cause of the problems you are seeing...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe, sometimes, the local Maven repo got corrupted and needs to be wiped out. I don&apos;t think that is the main issue in your case (since you described working with a brand new machine), but I thought I should mention that in case there is something wrong with your local Maven repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you import the mvc-showcase project via the &quot;Import Existing Maven Project&quot; when you used the workaround via git? If that succeeds, than the link on the Dashboard should work as well (this situation confuses me a bit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thanks a lot for posting your results here. I am sure we will find out what is going wrong there.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="87052" author="hoffit" created="Sun, 20 Jan 2013 10:37:41 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s all running together now - too many machines and too many scenarios. Once I get my laptop back (hopefully next week), I will start walking through, and documenting, some scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="87064" author="mlippert" created="Mon, 21 Jan 2013 02:23:42 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;That would be much appreciated. Looking forward to hearing about scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="87186" author="hoffit" created="Tue, 22 Jan 2013 13:05:28 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I was able to replicate this issue today (to some extent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario: Create new project from Spring MVC template&lt;br/&gt;
Environment: Windows 7 clean factory build. JDK 1.6_38. STS 3.1. Everything is the 64 bit version. Home network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note about STS install. There is one warning at the end of the install:&lt;br/&gt;
The windows program compatibility assistant complains about the STS install. I just indicated that I thought it installed correctly and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note about STS startup. It complains about not having EGIT and about not having a HOME variable set. I ignore these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create new project from spring template - using Spring MVC template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Result: 24 errors. See attached spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple clean operations, reboots, restarts fail to have an impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maven download sources - no affect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maven force update project - success! all errors gone and just a few warnings left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now - in previous attempts along this same line - the maven force update did not fix the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next Scenario: Bring in the samples project by clicking the link in spring. Takes about 8 minutes but did work this time. Was able to drop the project onto the TC server and run the sample app.  This did not work before. &lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="87207" author="hoffit" created="Tue, 22 Jan 2013 20:15:53 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m going to take a stab at answering the question about the root cause of all these issues. What they all seem to have in common, is missing resources. Repeated clean/build and maven/updates seems to fail to correct these issues - MOST of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found one site that addresses the issue: &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5074063/maven-error-failure-to-transfer&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5074063/maven-error-failure-to-transfer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fix is to hack the problematic maven .lastUpdated files (delete them) and then try updating the project again. If you do this enough times, I think all resources will eventually get downloaded, and consequently, all of the compile errors will go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note - there are many confusing error items such as those in the spreadsheet above. I believe the root cause of all of them is ultimately that some dependent resources are not getting pulled from the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick in the end is focusing on the maven errors first, before going nuts trying to figure out a myriad of compile/other types of errors. Having never used Maven before, or understood its purpose, that was not obvious until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For newbies who try and get started with Spring, a more friendly tool experience would include a check for a proper build, with instructions for how to resolve the issue. But - perhaps this JIRA issue will be searchable and others will more quickly resolve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this would be an uncommon experience though - because I believe it is related to my slow home network. Most folks, particularly software engineers, are going to be working on high bandwidth networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I would qualify the feature request as a nice-to-have, and call this issue resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
