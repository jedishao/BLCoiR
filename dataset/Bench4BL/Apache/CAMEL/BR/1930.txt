Synchronized access to XPathExpression resulting in contention for multiple consumers.
Hi,
I'm using Camel to do some JMS message routing. Messages are XML so xpath is a natural choice.
However when using a choice with an xpath expression, the XPathBuilder creates one XPathExpression object. According to the specification, these objects are not thread safe so synchronizing looks natural. But then, using multiple jms consumers is totally useless since no concurrent evaluations can be made.
XPathExpression objects would rather need to be stored in a ThreadLocal to avoid synchronization and contention.
Cheers,
