SjmsConsumer and SjmsProducer do not remove thread pool when stopSjmsConsumer and SjmsProducer always register a new ThreadPool on Camel context ExecutorServiceManager every time a new instance is created for an endpoint.
If consumer or producer is stopped or removed or even component is removed, thread pool still exists.
