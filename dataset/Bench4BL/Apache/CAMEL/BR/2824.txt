Deadlock in org.apache.camel.util.DefaultTimeoutMapAfter running a camel route with a camel Aggregator for a while, I get a deadlock in org.apache.camel.util.DefaultTimeoutMap. 
A full processdump is attached to this bug.
I have also tried to recreate this as failing testcase, but without any luck so far.
