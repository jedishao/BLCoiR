thread() and File Components.
I just experimented with adding calls to thread(10) to my route to make it multithreaded. This definitely speeds up by route, but it keeps throwing java.nio.channels.OverlappingFileLockException  errors and leaving lock files behind it.  The start of my route looks like
from("file:startDirectory?move=endDirectory")
.threads(10)
.bean("myBean", "myMethod")
Afterwards, my route ran successfully but an OverlappingFileLockException was thrown for every file that was read and all the lock files were left in my source directory.
