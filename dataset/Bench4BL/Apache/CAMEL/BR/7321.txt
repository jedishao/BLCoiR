JcrConsumer freezes in some environments.
In January Willem Jiang reported that the JUnit test JcrConsumerTest fails in his environment. This could not be reproduced in other environments at that time. Willem Jiang applied the following fix to the pom.xml in order make the test pass:
camel-jcr/pom.xml

[...]

  &lt;build&gt;

    &lt;plugins&gt;

     &lt;plugin&gt;

        &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;

        &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-surefire-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;

        &lt;configuration&gt;

          &lt;forkMode&gt;pertest&lt;/forkMode&gt;

        &lt;/configuration&gt;

     &lt;/plugin&gt;

    &lt;/plugins&gt;

  &lt;/build&gt;

This made all tests run in separate processes, but was also an indicator for potential multi-threading issues in JcrConsumer. I was recently able to reproduce the problem by running Maven within Eclipse. The problem is indeed a synchronization issue and should be addressed with this ticket.
