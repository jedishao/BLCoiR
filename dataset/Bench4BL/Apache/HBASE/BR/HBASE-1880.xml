            <title>[HBASE-1880] DeleteColumns are not recovered properly from the write-ahead-log</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-1880</link>
                <project id="12310753" key="HBASE">HBase</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;I found a couple of issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The timestamp is being set to now after it has been written to the wal. So if the WAL was flushed on that write, it gets in with ts of MAX_INT and is effectively lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Even after that fix, I had issues getting the delete to apply properly. In my case, the WAL had a put to a column, then a DeleteColumn for the same column. The DeleteColumn KV had a later timestamp, but it was still lost on recovery. I traced around a bit, and it looks like the current approach of just using an HFile.writer to write the set of KVs read from the log will not work. There is special logic in MemStore for deletes that needs to happen before writing. I got around this by just adding to memstore in the log recovery process. Not sure if there are other implications of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New approach of filling the memstore with WAL entries needs review.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12761418" author="clint.morgan" created="Fri, 2 Oct 2009 00:00:07 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Looks like putting in memstore and not flushing is bad. If we crash again, then we will loose the edits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adds a flush if we read any edits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fixes my failure tests, running hbase tests now.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12761436" author="clint.morgan" created="Fri, 2 Oct 2009 00:54:12 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;TestClient.testDeletes fails:  Expected 1 key but received 2&lt;br/&gt;
	at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestClient.testDeletes(TestClient.java:1266)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll look into it tomorrow...&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12761466" author="stack" created="Fri, 2 Oct 2009 04:01:54 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Patch looks good.  Moving writeToWAL till after the timestamp gets set seems like a no duh kinda thing (Can you fix the formatting &amp;#8211; its anti-easy-read at moment obviously product of a machine formatter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, no more reconstructeCache, just insert straight into memstore?  That solves another problem I was worried about in that we keep an eye on size of memstore but not on this reconstructionCache.  Removing it looks like a good move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, these new edits are not going into a WAL at all?  They should?  (Make a new issue? My sense is when a working flush all of our recovery will need to come out of the dark and get a spotlight shone on it).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12761662" author="clint.morgan" created="Fri, 2 Oct 2009 18:38:57 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Last patch broke the case when we have two deletes with LATEST timestamp. If so, then we need for the first delete to get into the store, so it removes the first version, then the second delete will get the timestamp of the second version to remove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good thing for unit tests, as the change did seem harmless. TestClient now passes. I&apos;ll run the full suite again...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patch also removes the delete KVs that get discarded because there is nothing to delete. So they don&apos;t get in the WAL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Stack&lt;br/&gt;
Yeah, writing to memstore directly. Currently its wired up to flush memstore during log recovery, but this would be a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;these new edits are not going into a WAL at all?&quot; Yeah thats right, we talk to the memstore directly rather than go through HRegion which does the WALing. This is ok because those edits were coming from a WAL anyway. The key is we need to flush after the recovery so that we no longer need that WAL we just read to recover in case of subsequent crash.&lt;/p&gt;

Store.runReconstructionLog has the same comments introduced/changed in this patch...&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12870706" author="stack" created="Mon, 24 May 2010 16:56:02 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;OK Clint.  I see the HStore edits now.  I was looking for the HRegion changes.  HRegion seems to have evolved significantly from when your patch was applied.  I can see ghost outlines of what you added in HRegion.  Resolving.  We can open new issue if this still an issue.  Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
