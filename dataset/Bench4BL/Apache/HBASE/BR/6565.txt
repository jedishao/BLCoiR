Coprocessor exec result Map is not thread safe.
I develop a coprocessor program, but found some different results in repeated tests.
for example, normally, the result's size is 10. but sometimes it appears 9.
I read the HTable.java code, found a TreeMap(thread-unsafe) be used in multithreading environment. It cause the bug happened.
