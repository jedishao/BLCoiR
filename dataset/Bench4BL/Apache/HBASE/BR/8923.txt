ChaosMonkey test teardown may fail due to race with ChaosMonkey.
If chaosmonkey restarts RS at the last moment before test teardown happens, cluster recovery may not see it in cluster status; however, RS process is already running, so when cluster recovery also tries to start it, it gets ExitCodeException. Boom!
