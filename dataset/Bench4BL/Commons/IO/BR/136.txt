HexDump's use of static StringBuffers isn't thread-safe.
HexDump has two private static dump() method's that alter static instances of StringBuffer:
dump(long) modifies static StringBuffer variable _lbuffer returning _lbuffer 
dump(char) modifies static StringBuffer variable _cbuffer returning _cbuffer
Both these methods are called by the public static dump(byte[], long, OutputStream, int) method. Multiple threads calling the public dump method at the same time could cause these StringBuffer to contain mixed up data and result in a bug.
