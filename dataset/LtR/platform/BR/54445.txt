Bug 54445  [Jobs] Duplicate search marker jobsBuild 20040310

While doing operations, I got locked while a build was running. Looking at the 
progress, I observed there were 3 instances of a searching marker job in the 
queue, awaiting to proceed.

The scheduling of these search jobs should be smart enough to avoid stepping on 
itself. If it is already scheduled, it shouldn't reschedule one, or if doing 
so, it should cancel pre-enqueued one.
