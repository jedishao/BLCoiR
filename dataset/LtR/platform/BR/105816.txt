Bug 105816  Extraneous NLS tag incorrectly found in commentsI20050802-0800  
  
In CoolBarManager (org.eclipse.jface) there are NLS tags inside of  
commented-out blocks of code.  These are being reported as compiler errors  
(when "Usage of non-externalized strings" is set to error).  NLS tags inside  
of commented-out sections should be ignored. 
 
If the commented-out sections were uncommented, then the NLS tags would not be 
errors.
