Bug 89891  [Progress] ErrorNotificationManager parenting off of the wrong shell20050331

When we open an error dialog we parent off of the current window. In the case
where there is already a modal dialog open this can result in two dialogs
blocked on a readAndDispatch.

We should use Stefans new shell provider.
