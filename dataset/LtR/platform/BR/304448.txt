Bug 304448  E4Workbench never locks the instance areaThe E4Workbench never appears to lock the instance area for the workspace.  This means multiple instances could be launched which use the same instance area.

org.eclipse.e4.workbench.ui.internal.ResourceHandler.ResourceHandler(Location, URI, boolean, Logger) constructor gets the instance area URL but it never attempts to lock the instance area.  Is this intentional or an oversight?
