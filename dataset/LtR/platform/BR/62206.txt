Bug 62206  [Progress] Blocked save shows window title in progress dialogbuild I20040513-1200

- my laptop crashed
- on restart of Eclipse, did a Ctrl+B (auto-build is off), and ran it in the bg
- this was a full build due to the crash
- while this was going on, edited and saved a file (ViewFactory.java)
- the save was blocked by the build and the blocked progress dialog came up
- the build job was the first one and was working
- the second job was the save, I guess, but its label was the same as the window
title:
Java - ViewFactory.java - d:\eclipse-new\plugins - Eclipse Platform

Perhaps this is because Save uses the window as its runnable context?

A better label would be "Saving ViewFactory.java".  Not sure if this is
achievable though.
