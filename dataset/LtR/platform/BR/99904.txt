Bug 99904  [RCP] Layout not updated when visibility of coolbar, perspectivebar etc. toggled after startupIt is possible to customize the workbench via the WorkbenchWindowAdvisor during 
startup. For my RCP application i need to customize the behavior after startup, 
so that i can implement somithing like "system locking". In this case i like to 
hide all bars (menubar, coolbar, perspective bar, fastview bar ...), so that 
the user has no possibility to interact with the system. The user must login  
again to get access to the system. By now i implement this using follwoing code 
snippset:

    private void setBarVisibility(boolean visibility) {
        
        WorkbenchWindow window = (WorkbenchWindow)
            PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow();
        
        configurer.setShowProgressIndicator(visibility);                        
        configurer.setShowCoolBar(visibility);
        configurer.setShowMenuBar(visibility);
        configurer.setShowStatusLine(visibility);        
        
        window.setCoolBarVisible(visibility);    
        window.setPerspectiveBarVisible(visibility);         
        
        PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getShell().layout
();
    }

The access to the Workbench is discouraged due to restrictions defined in the 
required library. It would be nice to have API methods to perform this task.

kind regards
