Bug 68579  [Progress] Cleared error still in progress error list3.0 

I get a dialog when there are problems synchronizing my workspace via
Synchronize view (see picture 1). I select the error and click "Clear".
Observe: the error stays in the progress icon (bottom right)

Click on the progress icon (bottom right)
==> I get exactly the same error presented (see picture 2) that I already cleared.

I would expect that "Clear" removes it from the progress error list.
