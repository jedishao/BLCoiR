Bug 262906  [http.registry]initializeDelegate in ServletManager.ServletWrapper should be synchronizedAB sent me an email which among things mentions a problem they encountered while load testing.

"The servlet's init() methods are called multiple times whenever we make simultaneous requests to the server before they have been initialized."

This is indeed a problem as we wrap each servlet that will look after lazily initializing the servlet and the relevant method -- initalizeMethod is not synchronized.
