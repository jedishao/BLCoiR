Bug 346624  [Browser] With the SystemBrowserInstance, IWebBrowser#openURL() fails unless called on the Display ThreadCQ:WIND00277253

When the Web Browser is configured to use the System Browser, calling
    IWebBrowser#openURL()
on a Thread other than the Display thread fails with following message:

  "Could not open a Web Browser because there are none configured.
   Check the Web Browser Preferences."

This is highly confusing for end users, because one (or even more) web browsers are properly configured. It's also confusing for end users, becasue IWebBrowser#openURL() API does not mention that it must be called on the Display Thread.

The reason for the problem is, that SWT Program#findProgram() is used in SystemBrowserInstance, and that API only works on the Display Thread.
