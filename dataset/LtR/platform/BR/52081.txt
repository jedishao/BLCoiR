Bug 52081  [ErrorHandling] Maintain some of original exception messageI've noticed now if an Editor is open, and some error occurs and it can not 
copy, only the message "Editor could not be intialized" is display and nothing
written to log. 

To see this, generate the sample editor plugin, then add (override) the 
getEditorInput method with something like this:
    public IEditorInput getEditorInput() {
        IllegalStateException exception = new IllegalStateException("tests 1");
        throw exception;
    }

From what I traced through, seems it would be easy to accumulate exception 
messages, or "reasons" to display to end user and/or log automatically (which is 
, I believe, what was done on 2.1 base.  Not sure this is really a "Text" issue, 
but thought it could start there. This may be related to changes in the 
Job instrastructure ... but from what I traced through, the "lowlevel" exception 
was passed up correctly from other threads, but then converted to 
PartInitException at somepoint without maintaining original info.
