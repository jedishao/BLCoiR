Bug 109528  [RCP] [Workbench] Eclipse automatically attempts to save modified files when OutOfMemoryException occursWe need a way to know if the workbench is closing because of an exception 
(such as OutOfMemoryError), since we want to change our save behaviour in that 
case to *not* save over the original file (Eclipse's default 'emergency close' 
behaviour), but to save to a temporary file instead.

It seems that all access points to IWorkbenchConfigurer are blocked off 
(default/private access).
