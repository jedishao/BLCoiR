Bug 64123  Memory leak in WorkbenchSiteProgressServiceThe dispose method of WorkbenchSiteProgressService is the following. Notide 
that if the waitCursor is null, the listener is not returned. If I close all 
open instances of the sync view, the waitCursor is null so a reference to the 
sync view stays around. The removeListener should either be done first or in a 
finally block.

	public void dispose() {
		if (updateJob != null)
			updateJob.cancel();
		if (waitCursor == null)
			return;
		waitCursor.dispose();
		waitCursor = null;
		ProgressManager.getInstance().removeListener(this);
	}
