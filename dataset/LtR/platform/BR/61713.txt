Bug 61713  MessageDialog can't be created in non UI thread anymoreI20040511

In the past it was possible to create a MessageDialog from non UI threads. 
This is not possible with I20040511 anymore. Doing so now results in an 
invalid thread access to due the fact that the images are now managed by SWT.
