Bug 175085  SWT errors due to oversized overlay iconI just updated to Eclipse 3.3 and received a lot of SWT errors. The trace
showed the cause to be imageData.setAlpha(xx,yy,alpha) called within
CompositeImageDescriptor.

Apparantly one of the projects in my workspace had the honour of receiving
a label overlay image with a size of 17x16 pixels. As the label image
is 16x16 pixels and the overlay image is drawn TopRight, the 
CompositeImageDescriptor.drawImage was called with parameter 'ox' being -1.

This in turn causes the ImageData.setAlpha() at the end of this method
to be called with 'xx' being -1, falling outside of the ImageData
boundaries and hence triggering the SWT error.

It seems the imageData.setPixel() call just above it is protected in
an 'if ( xx >= 0 && xx < imageData.width && yy > 0 ...)' block and a
solution might be to move the setAlpha() call also within this block.

But this part of Eclipse is totally new for me so correct me if I'm
looking at the wrong place, or let me know if you need more info.
