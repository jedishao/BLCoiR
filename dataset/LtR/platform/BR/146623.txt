Bug 146623  [Commands] Define command / retargetable action / keybinding for switching pages in a PageBookViewN20060611-0010

The platform should define a command for cycling through pages of a PageBookView (e.g. Search, Console, Synchronize) or other views that use a notion of switchable pages (e.g. JUnit, Type Hierarchy, Call Hierarchy).

There should be a retargetable action that can be used by views that want to support easy switching between their pages. The action cannot be bound by default, since some PageBookViews may not want to give the user this power (e.g. Outline), or they need to know about page switching events (e.g. JUnit).

Good default keybindings would be Alt+PageUp / Alt+PageDown.

Today, using such views is often cumbersome, since the views usually only offer a dropdown toolbar button, which has a very small target area to open a menu. Furthermore, opening the menu is unnecessary when the user already knows she wants to go to the previous/next page.
