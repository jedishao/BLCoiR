Bug 50277  Progress Window takes focus from editor when it opensbuild i0120, winxp, j9sc20031212

With today's integration build I noticed a "block of cheese" in my Java editor. 
Its light-coloured and square. We're guessing processed Swiss or Havarti.
When you click on this block, it removes focus from Eclipse.
When you move the Eclipse window, the block disappears.

To reproduce the block:
- double-click on the progress view icon (lower-left corner)
- didn't work? double-click again
- block will appear as light yellow high-lighted empty text block
- seems to always appear around the 63rd column of my editor
- click on block and Eclipse will lose focus
- move Eclipse window and block moves to lower left corner next to progress icon
- double-clicking the progress icon will remove the block entirely
