Bug 58942  Rewording in blocked jobs dialogAttached are the patches I made to the BlockedJobsDialog to achieve the wording
we agreed on.  It also removes the cancel button when the new progress viewer is
being used, and left-justifies the centre-justified text that Erich pointed out
as being unusual.
