Bug 67413  [KeyBindings] misc: Block accelerators that are in useI meet a error after following these steps:
- Remove hot keys Navigate->Open:F3 then add a new one Ctrl+Enter
- Remove hot keys Edit->Find Previous:Ctrl+Shift+K then add a new one Shift+F3
- Remove hot keys Edit->Find Next:Ctrl+K then add a new one F3

Everything work fine with the new assigned keys except for editing an ant file 
(build.xml). When editing ant file, the ui understand the old hot keys: F3 for 
open and Ctrl+K for Find Next.
