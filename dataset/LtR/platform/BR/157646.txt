Bug 157646  [Import/Export] "Import Existing Project" from zip locks file - prevents deletionBuild: M20060629-1905

Even though I cancel the Import Existing Project wizard without completing it, the zip file selected becomes (and remains) locked and cannot be deleted until the workbench is closed.

Steps:
File > Import > Existing Projects Into Workspace
Select a zip file that does not contain any projects
Cancel the wizard, but leave the workbench running
Attempt to delete the zipfile

Result:
On Windows XP, this will result in system error stating: "Cannot delete <filename>: It is being used by another person or program."

This problem will continue until the workbench is closed.
