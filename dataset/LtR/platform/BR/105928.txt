Bug 105928  [Progress] Blocked jobs dialog showing empty messageBuild: 3.1 final

Steve often gets into a state where the blocked jobs dialog appears (probably
due to slow builder performance from running with a workspace on a network
drive). Sometimes this dialog comes up with a task with an empty name (see
screenshot). The blocked task name is taken from the parent shell's text (see
BlockedJobsDialog#createBlockedDialog).  I think if this text is an empty
string, the default "User Operation" text should be used
(BlockedJobsDialog#getDisplayString).
