Bug 94129  [Workbench] Performance test regression caused by workbench harness changeN20050509

Core has a UI startup test that measures the time until UITestApplication starts
running.  This test had a 16% improvement over 3.0 in 3.1 M6, and since late
last week has a 33% regression.  This appears to be caused by a change in
Workbench that now waits until early startup participants complete, combined
with the new early startup participant in the ui test plugin that waits for
three seconds.

Discussing with Nick, the plan is to:
 - Remove the three second delay 
 - Add a system property to avoid blocking on early startup participants before
running the tests.  This would be used by any performance test that is sensitive
to startup time.
