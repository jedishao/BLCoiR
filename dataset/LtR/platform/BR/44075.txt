Bug 44075  Busy progress does not lock out all shellsThe new showBusyWhile API does not lock all of the workbench windows while 
working. Look at how application window does this to decide what to do.

We should consider if we want to lock the entire window or not while doing 
this. I think we do as this is API meant for jobs that are modal.
