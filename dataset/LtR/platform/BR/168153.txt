Bug 168153  [DataBinding] Simplify the management of the default RealmIn the bug where Realms where born there was talk of making the setting of the Realm a little more foolproof.  Currently when setting the Realm the developer needs to remember to retrieve the current Realm and to set it back in a finally block to be a good citizen.  I think Boris spoke of something like the following to remedy this...

Realm.setDefault(myRealm, new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
      //do stuff with myRealm as default
    }
});

I've been finding myself writing a method that does just this in my own code.  I think this should be added to Realm to ensure that the default realm is being set and reset correctly.
