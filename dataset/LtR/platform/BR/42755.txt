Bug 42755  [Jobs] Access Job List While Having a Modal DialgogI20030903

It would be good if users could access the job list even if a modal dialog is in
their face.

Modal dialogs can now block the UI waiting for a background job to finish and
users can no longer stop the job which actually eats the CPU. There should be a
way to access the job list even if a modal dialog is up.

Use Case:
I started my workspace and it began to run auto-build (don't know why) in the
background (therefore I did not notice). I then compared a file with CVS and the
whole workbench looked as if it was locked. I had no chance to kill the
auto-build job since a modal CVS dialog was in my face. For some reason the CVS
dialog was waiting for the build to complete.
