Bug 73926  [Decorators] [RCP] NoClassDefFoundError: org/eclipse/ui/internal/progress/TaskInfoWe are building an RCP application based on 3.0 Eclipse.  In general, things
work extremely well.  We have an intermittent problem during application
shutdown where we get the above NoClassDefFoundError.  It appears that this is
probably a race condition that causes the associated classloader to be shut down
before the decorators thread has been stopped.  Because this happens during
shutdown, it does not have a detrimental effect on the running of the
application, although it may induce some concern amongst users of the
application if it occurs.

The full stack trace that is written to the console follows:

java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/eclipse/ui/internal/progress/TaskInfo
