Bug 67267  [Progress] PROPERTY_IN_DIALOG needs to be API and needs to be documentedProgressManager#PROPERTY_IN_DIALOG was supposed to be moved to public
IProgressConstants because it is referenced by clients. 

Also, there seems to be no documentation on when this property can be tested by
clients. For example, when can a job query this property and be ensured that the
progress dialog has set the property. Currently the CVS synchronize jobs are
broken because the property only seems to be set when the dialog is actually
opened and thus since this happens with a delay, the job doesn't un-set the KEEP
property and all completed synchronizations linger in the progress view.

I suggest that Ui does the following:
1. ask for API change permission
2. see if the property can be set earlier
