Bug 13305  A suspicious System.out.println in org.eclipse.internal.ui.WorkbenchActionBuilderBuild: M5 candidate

Description:
The protected method addManualIncrementalBuildAction in 
org.eclipse.internal.ui.WorkbenchActionBuilder catches IllegalArgumentException 
in a few places, and, in the last such catch block, it makes a call to 
System.out.println("build action not found");.  Perhaps it should be reviewed.
