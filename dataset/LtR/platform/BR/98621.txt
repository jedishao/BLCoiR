Bug 98621  [refactoring] [rename] Rename Type hangsI renamed a (foolishly misspelled) class I18L to I18N. The class looked like this:

public class I18N {

	protected static void loadMessages(Class clazz, String name) {
		...
	}
}

The class was extended in 10 subclasses in 8 projects, like this:

public class Messages extends I18L {
  public static String unexpectedException;
  ...
  static {
    loadMessages(Messages.class, "messages.properties");
  }
}

I clicked OK in the dialog. After about 5 minutes, I clicked Cancel. The only
noticeable effect was the Cancel button was disabled. Clicking the window exit
box had no effect. I didn't have a Java console window so couldn't get a thread
dump. I finally killed Eclipse with the Task Manager (WinXP SP2).

When I restarted Eclipse, 7 of the references had been changed to I18N and 3 had
not. Open Type (after re-indexing its database) still shows the non-existant
I18L type, though if you try to open it, the path cannot be found.
