Bug 184688  org.eclipse.ui.dialogs.SearchPattern has a few painful glitchesHEAD

org.eclipse.ui.dialogs.SearchPattern as a few painful glitches that need to be corrected ASAP, since they cause subtle problems in the Open Type dialog.

I'll attach a fix for these problems:
- calls String#trim() when only last character should be deleted
- should detect string ending in " " or "<" as RULE_EXACT_MATCH, not RULE_CAMELCASE_MATCH
- isValidCamelCaseChar(..) always returns true

To reproduce the problems of the blocked bugs, you usually have to type very quickly (or paste the whole pattern).
