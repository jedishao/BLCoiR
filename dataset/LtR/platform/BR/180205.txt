Bug 180205  [Progress] Progress view shows two entries for same jobI20070327-0800

* Start workbench
* Select projects and "Team > synchronize with repository" (I selected all debug projects in this case)
* Perspective automatically switches to team
* Progress view was in foreground, and shows two jobs for the same "synch" job
* Pressing "Remove all finished operations" button on progress view removes one of the jobs

Screen shots to be attached.
