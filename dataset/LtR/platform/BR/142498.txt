Bug 142498  [WorkingSets] TVT3.2:TCT539: DA: Working Window Set in EnglishOS: RHEL 3.1
Must fix or not a must fix: YES
Build date: 051606
Component name = EMFT
Blocking: NO
Language: da
Bitmap Location: V:\defects\da
Tester Name: Mette Djoerup (user ID: dantvt03)
Problem Description:

In the Package Explorer view, click the menu icon in the top right corner. A string is in English: Window Working Set.

This string has been translated and is found in the eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.ui.workbench\org\eclipse\ui\internal\messages.properties file.

If it has been translated and it was in the last build than it should be viewable to you.  Ensure that you have added "-clean" when you start eclipse.  To do this in linux (from your eclipse root directory):

./eclipse -clean

Or if you are running from windows:

Right click on your eclipse shortcut and add "-clean" to the end of your target path.

Starting eclipse with the -clean option does not help. The string was probably never in the build.

The newest build is not ready but will be available later today.  Check with the new driver then to see if the string is present.  It not, please re-drop it with the rest of your files.

Same in Norwegian version.

Reopening to open a bug... it doesn't look like the string is externalized.
