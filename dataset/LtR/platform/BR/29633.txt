Bug 29633  [EditorMgmt] "Open" menu should have Open With-->OtherWhile registering file associations in the preferences page is mostly a 
reasonable proposition, it seems that having an "Open With --> Other" option 
would be helpful.  

This came up originally for me registering .sqlj files with the Java Editor.  
For unrelated reasons Eclipse is getting locked up by external tools, and I 
keep having to re-specify my preference since I had to kill Eclipse and the 
workspace was not saved. The implementation may also be helpful for 
contributers with editors on non-file resources, as they could reuse whatever 
dialog pops up when Open With --> Other is presented.
