Bug 5675  TVT: Export of multiple projects to Zip file fails while processing .vcm_meta fileSteps to recreate:

1. Create simple project "a"
2. Create simple project "b"
3. Create file "aaa" in project a.
4. Create file "bbb" in project b.
5. Release the two projects to the repository with "Synchronize with Stream"
6. Step 5 creates a .vcm_meta file for each project.  Now select File > Export.
7. Select "Zip File", and Finish (see image1).
8. Error message is displayed "Error exporting /b/.vcm_meta" (see image2).

FWIW, it would be nice to have a more informative error message.
