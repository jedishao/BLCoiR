Bug 68608  [Dialogs] Resource deletion could be run in the backgroundIf I delete a resource in Eclipse and the deletion is blocked by another job, 
I get a blocked dialog. I then have to wait until the blocking job finishes. 
It would be nice if I could have the deletion run in the background  and occur 
when it can. In essence, this is what happens in window except that windows 
uses a non-modal dialog instead of a "Run in Background" button.
