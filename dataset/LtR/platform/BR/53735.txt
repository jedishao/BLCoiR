Bug 53735  [KeyBindings] Can't override keys in "editing java context" using general contextI'm using M7.

Here is what I tried to do:
I did not like the switch to mapping toggle comment by default, so I decided 
to replace the key shortcuts for comment and uncomment.  For comment, I used 
the old key of ctrl+/.  For uncomment I used ctrl+shift+/.  Comment works 
fine.  Uncomment does not.  The new keystroke shows up in workbench->keys 
correctly.  I can assign Uncomment to its old value (ctrl+\) or a different 
value (shift+f4) and it works fine.  One thing I did do was remove the 
previous association with "Add Block Comment".  For ctrl+shift+/, ABC was 
mapped in the "Editing Java Source" context, while I was mapping Uncomment in 
the general context.  

Afer some more investigation, here is the problem.  When I added the uncomment 
shortcut, I added it in the "General" context.  So I had two assignments for 
ctrl+shift+/.
1. General - Uncomment
2. Editing Java Source - Add Block Comment

So I selected the Add Block Comment one and pressed the "Remove" button.  Now 
I still have the 2 lines, but the "Uncomment" line has a plus beside it and 
the "ABC" line has a minus beside it (and says unassigned).

So my guess is that the key shortcut lookup gets stuck at the "Editing Java 
Source" context because of the Unassigned key.  

If I add ctrl+shift+/ as the keystroke for Uncomment at the "Editing Java 
Source" context level, then the keymapping works.
