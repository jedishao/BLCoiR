Bug 391626  [Compatibility] e4 does not implement the post-selection conceptSteps to Reproduce:
1. Create a simple html file
  1: <html>
  2:   <head>
  3:   </head>
  4:   <body>
  5:     <p>Text</p>
... repeat above line 100 times
105:   </body>
106: </html>
2. Go to line 105
3. Press and hold Shift+UpArrow

The outline scrolls hard and hard(moving up and down). The cursor runs without block-seletion(region highlighted), and then selecting lines takes a few seconds per line.

Turning off Link-with-Editor is the only workaround for now.
