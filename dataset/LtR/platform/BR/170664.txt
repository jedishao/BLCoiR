Bug 170664  [About] Signature checking in About dialog doesn't scaleBuild: I20070112

The about dialog currently spawns one worker/thread for each plugin in order to verify signatures.  This doesn't scale, since it causes hundreds or possibly thousands of threads to be running simultaneously.  There should be a single job for checking signatures, or the jobs should have a scheduling rule to prevent them from running concurrently.
