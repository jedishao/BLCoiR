Bug 31028  [Workbench] Workbench isStartingI know its not part of the API, but the isStarting flag is initialized to false 
when the instance of Workbench is created (and then set to true in init() which 
is called from run()). This leaves a little time in there at the beginning that 
isStarting returns false, as though its already started, but in fact has not 
yet started starting :)  If it was set to true in instance creation, I think it 
would not leave this short "indeterminite" state at the beginning of its 
lifecyle. I encountered this bug when trying to write some (internal) automated 
tests that had some stuff going on in one thread, and wanted to wait until the 
workbench was started before beginning some tests.
