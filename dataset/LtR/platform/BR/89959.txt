Bug 89959  [Progress] Progress dialog stayed up when no activity happening, with no details and only cancel buttonbuild I20050331-2000

- had a workspace sync going on in the background
- it was near completion
- did a sync on another resource from PE
- got the Progress Information / Operation in progress... dialog, but it showed
no further details
- just before this came up, I saw an error dialog come up from the first sync
(it's complaining that it was unable to connect to one repo, but this is an
expected error given my workspace)
- the error dialog is not visible, even if I move the progress dialog
- but a button for it does appear in the task tray titled "Synchronizing CVS
(Workspace)"  (though maybe this is the original progress dialog for the first
sync, not the error dialog)
- stack traces show only activity in the UI thread (no deadlock), waiting on
ErrorNotificationManager's ErrorDialog

In a twist of irony, the first sync was showing the incoming change for
ErrorNotificationManager <g>.
