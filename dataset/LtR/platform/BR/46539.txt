Bug 46539  [Dialogs] "Save resources"  dialog shows duplicated entriesi20031111

The "Save resources" dialog, opened whenever I am about to do things like run a
launch configuration or synchronize or shoutdown Eclipse, shows duplicated entries.

For instance, if I have dirty editors with files A/foo.txt and A/bar.txt, and do
something that triggers that dialog, it will show:

X A/foo.txt
X A/bar.txt
  A/foo.txt
  A/bar.txt 

For each pair of duplicated entries, one is checked to be saved by default.
