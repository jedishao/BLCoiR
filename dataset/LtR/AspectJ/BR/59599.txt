Bug 59599  Race condition in test suite for incrementalOn faster machines (my linux desktop, andy's home pc) several of the tests in
ajcTests.xml are failing (suite attached). This appears to be due to a race 
condition between checking directory contents and waiting for the compilation to 
complete. I have an environment in which I can test candidate fixes if you can 
give me a pointer for what to tweak...
