Bug 62401  [Actions] ReferenceCleanerThread in ActionContributionItem cause application can not exit normally.When the standalone application exit, the display disposed, will call
ReferenceCleanerThread.stopCleaning() method, it simply set the running
field to false, but "reference = referenceQueue.remove();" in line 196
still blocking. And you must call System.exit() explicitlly to terminate
the currently running Java Virtual Machine. so I think it is a bug.

My env: XP home edition, jdk 1.4.2_04, and eclipse-SDK-I20040514-win32

Eric
