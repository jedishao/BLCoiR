Bug 191684  [StatusHandling] Status Dialog needs enhancementsStatus Dialog it lacks some functionality:
* selection change is not propagated to ErrorSupportProvider
* there is no possibility of adding actions that should execute after closing the dialog - I would like to be able to launch Troubleshoot wizard or something like that. Or even simple workspace synchronization.

Status Dialog is ugly. I think it would be nice, if the details were displayed as sections (like in compiler->errors/warnings preference page).
