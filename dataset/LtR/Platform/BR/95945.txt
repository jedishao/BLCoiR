Bug 95945  [Navigator ] Opening compare editor switches to Java editorTo reproduce this issue:

1. Open a .java, .xml etc. file that has been modified since last cvs checkout 
in resource/java perspective.
2. Synchronize  entire project -> switch to synchronize perspective
3. Double click a changed file that is NOT currently open in perspective - you
get a side-by-side compare view of the two files (good).
4. Double click the changed file that was opened in step 1. The side-by-side
perspective is displayed for a second, and then the display switches to the
single file view of this file instead of staying in the compare view.

You have to close the file in the perspective in order for the comparison to
keep focus which is really annoying when you want to see the diffs between local
and repository versions on a file you are working on. 

This did not happen in 3.1M5, I upgraded from M5 to M7 so this bug was
introduced in either M6 or M7.
