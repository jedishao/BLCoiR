Bug 65570  ProgressViewUpdater looses eventsRC1

In method runInUIThread() the copying of add/delete/update events from the 
updateInfo structure into an array and the reset of the updateInfo structure is 
not an atomic operation. As a consequence all events that are added after the 
original events have been copied are lost.
Most likely this is one reason for the leaking jobs in the progress viewer.
