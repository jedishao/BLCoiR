Bug 72868  [Progress] Blocked by invisible job20040824

After starting eclipse on a old, big workspace I selected to import plugins and
fragments. On finish, the blocking dialog showed up, but the only entry listed
was the 'import plugin' itself. After 10 minutes the blocking dialog was gone,
so it seems that a job was blocking that was not shown in the list.
I suspect a system job that didn't cancel

-> The blocked dialog should offer to show system jobs or detect the situation
where it waits for a job not shown in the UI and then shows that Job (at least
for debugging reasons to see which system job caused the blockade)
