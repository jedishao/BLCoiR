Bug 45460  [Workbench] Disable of autobuild on Workbench#init no longer neededIn the Workbench#init(String[] commandLineArgs, final Display display) method, 
the disable of the autobuild while editors are opened should no longer be 
needed since autobuilds are now done in the background. Actually, keeping the 
disable in is a problem because, on startup, the workbench blocks (busycursor) 
while the build is taking place, making the user wait needlessly.
