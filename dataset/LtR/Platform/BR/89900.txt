Bug 89900  [Progress] showInDialog blocks if the parentShell is modal20050331

IProgressService#showInDialog blocks until all modal shells are closed. This
will mean that it will not open if it is called on a modal parent.

ProgressMonitorFocusJobDialog should check if the shell blocking it is the
specified parent - if so then it should proceed.

We also should remove the code that looks for a non modal parent in the null
case and fall through to the new shell provider.
