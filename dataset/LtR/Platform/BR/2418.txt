Bug 2418  [UI] Status line messgae remains after fastview is closed (1GF1RPI)TM (6/9/2001 11:39:21)
	SDK 121

	1) I was catching up with changes. I do this in a fastview of the "synchronize" view in the java
		perspective.
	2) when I was done, I clicked the fastview icon on the left workspace window border.
	3) the fastview closed

	4) observe: I still could see the status line message fromt he synchronize view (No conflicts, ...)

	This problem is still here in 0.202 build. It can be reproduced with any views. Once the fast view
	is hidden, no other view/editor is given focus.

	This should be fixed in the bigger context of proper focus & z-order handling. That is, focus
	should go to the pevious part that had focus.
