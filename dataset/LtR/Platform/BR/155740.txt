Bug 155740  [Undo] - AdvancedValidationUserApprover accesses UI without using async/syncThe documentation for IOperationApprover says that implementors must be prepared to receive notifications from a background thread.  AdvancedValidationUserApprover does not use the SWT sync or async when accessing UI.  It has gotten away with this thus far because most validation is triggered by the undo/redo action handlers in the UI thread.  However, when an operation is initially executed, it can come from a background thread.

This surfaces in the implementation of some of the resource modifying undoable operations which operate in a background thread and require approval.
