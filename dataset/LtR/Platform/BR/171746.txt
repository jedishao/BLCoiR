Bug 171746  [DataBinding] [Workbench] Set default realm in createAndRunWorkbench()The data binding framework, being at the core level, does not know about SWT but has a notion of a "default realm" that corresponds to SWT's default display.  (Realm has #asyncExec and #syncExec.)

The Workbench should initialize the default realm to be the SWT UI thread.
