Bug 174580  [Progress] Progress user dialog not resizeableBuild ID: I20070209-1006

Steps To Reproduce:
resizing (worked with 3.3M4 but doesn't with 3.3M5)
1. Start any task that opens a progress popup (e.g. synchronizing a project)
2. Try to resize (won't work, did in the past)

backgrounding:
1. Start any task that opens a progress popup which doesn't offer the "run in background" button (e.g. starting a Profile Application task)

More information:
not being able to resize is annoying if you open the details and it has shows of entries.
not being able to background the window is annoying when the task takes a minute or two because ot blocks the entire UI and you can't do anything about it.
