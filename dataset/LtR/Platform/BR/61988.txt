Bug 61988  [Activities] Performance of WorkbenchActivitySupport.setEnabledActivityIdsI20040512 - 0800

Steps:

1) Launch a runtime workbench from a self hosting workspace in debug mode
2) After the workbench has started, suspend all threads
3) Expand the main thread, and select it in the Debug view
4) Hold down "Down arrow" to scroll down the stack frames.

This is extremely slow.  When profiling, I noticed a third of the time is taken
by WorkenchActivitySupport.setEnabledIds (see attached profiler output).  In
actual fact, the set of enabled activities *never* changes in this scenario.
Each call to MutableActivityManager.setEnabledActivityIds is providing the exact
same set of activities. It actually detects this case, but then proceeds to call
updateIdentifiers, which does some expensive pattern matching computations
(725,000 invocations of Pattern$Dot.match, for example).
