Bug 108162  [Progress] [IDE] Deadlock using MoveFilesAndFoldersOperation from a refactoring participantWe provide a Resource Move refactoring participant for resources managed by 
our plug-in. The following line of code in the participant causes the deadlock:

    new MoveFilesAndFoldersOperation(<the active shell>).copyResources(<some 
resources>, <destination container>);

The MoveFilesAndFoldersOperation class is from the "org.eclipse.ui.actions" 
package.
