Bug 363856  [DI] Erroneous field injection?BuildId: I20111028-1100
OS: MacOS X (only because it demonstrates the problem)

The CocoaUIProcessor requests the MApplication through injection.  But an interesting thing occurs: when the MApplication instance is set (in E4Application#createE4Workbench()), the injector actually tries to inject with a created instance of MApplication, which fails.  This can be seen if you place a breakpoint on InjectionException:

Daemon Thread [Thread-1] (Suspended (exception InjectionException))	
	InjectorImpl.internalMake(Class<?>, PrimaryObjectSupplier, PrimaryObjectSupplier) line: 326	
	InjectorImpl.resolveArgs(Requestor, PrimaryObjectSupplier, PrimaryObjectSupplier, boolean, boolean, boolean) line: 450	
	InjectorImpl.resolveArguments(IRequestor, boolean) line: 334	
	FieldRequestor(Requestor).resolveArguments(boolean) line: 115	
	ContextObjectSupplier$ContextInjectionListener.update(IEclipseContext, int, Object[]) line: 76

	EclipseContext.set(String, Object) line: 321	
	E4Application.createE4Workbench(IApplicationContext, Display) line: 231	

(I often trap InjectionException as it seems the best way to discover why a handler isn't being invoked.)
