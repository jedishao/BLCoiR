Bug 310394  [CommonNavigator] CommonViewer refresh never turns on redraw sometimes - Breaks Team sync viewBuild ID: I20100424-2000

When I perform
  Team > Synchronize or
  Compare With > Latest from HEAD
the Synchronize View remains empty.

This is with an existing workspace and several Eclipse projects in there (including o.e.core.resources, which I have modified locally). 

Using I20100422-1310 on the very same workspace / project, I do see the expected changes. Using I20100424-2000 I just get an empty synchronize view.

I'm assuming that this issue would block some testing of Platform/Team related functionality during the M7 test pass.
