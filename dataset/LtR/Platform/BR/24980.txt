Bug 24980  [Wizards] Progress not shown in Wizards20021016

Wizards have the same problem with not showing updated Text during a progress
done within the UI thread as the ProgressMonitorDialog had. It should use the
same sort of fix as 21382 where Control.update() is called when running in the
UI Thread.
