Bug 189161  [WorkbenchLauncher] Splash javadoc nitsFrom Susans analysis of the splash API:

I took a look at the splash API. 
Honestly, I don't have a lot of context on the requirements, but I did take enough of a look to pick nits: 

- the package.html refers to the org.eclipse.ui.splashHandler extension point (singular), but the extension point doc says org.eclipse.ui.splashHandlers 

- getSplash() - is the only method that doesn't specify whether it is called from the UI thread (I assume it is since it's purpose is to get a shell, but all the other methods tell me specifically) 

- missing word in javadoc for getBundleProgressMonitor(), shown in red below. 

         * <code>true</code>. Because this property defaults to <code>false</code> 
         * RCP developers must set this property via a 
         * <code>plugin_customization.ini</code> file or by setting the preference 

- extension point doc nits: 
        - misspelled word "proceedure" in first paragraph 
        - second paragraph "It is possibly" should be "It is possible" 
        - last paragraph (Supplied Implementation) misspelled word "absense"
