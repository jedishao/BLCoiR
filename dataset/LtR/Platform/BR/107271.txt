Bug 107271  [Preferences] [RCP] FilteredPreferenceDialog should allow history and filtering to be turned offWe have built an Eclipse RCP based application.  The application was initially
built and shipped on top of Eclipse 3.0.  The application uses the standard
PropertyDialog provided by the platform.  We are in the process of moving to
Eclipse 3.1 to pick up a few things from the platform.  In the process, we are
being forced to pick up this new UI behavior in the property dialog that we
don't necessarily want or need.  The number of pages that will be contributed to
the dialog is probably going to be fairly small.  Adding these controls means
that our documentation folks are now going to have to document how they work and
update screen snapshots.  Changes like this to the UI should be made in such a
way that they are not forced to be inherited by the RCP applications that are
using them.  Whether that is by changing the class hierarchy or using some other
means doesn't much matter.  With the advent of the RCP framework, the "customer
base" of the platform UI is potentially much larger than just the IDE and these
basic building blocks need to remain stable over time.  Please provide a way to
turn off these controls in the properties dialog.  Even more importantly, please
make sure not to make future changes to core user interface functionality that
cannot be selectively turned off.  These basic building blocks need to be
treated much the same as API is within Eclipse.

Thanks.
