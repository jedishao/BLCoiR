Bug 51596  [Jobs] Progress Dialog on dual monitor setup opens on the wrong monitorBuild I20040205 on WIN NT/SP6.

I have a dual monitor setup and I usually run eclipse on the second monitor.
The normal progress dialog opens correctly centered on the second monitor. 

The new progress monitor (the one which shows that a operation is blocked by a
background process with the list of background tasks operating) always opens on
the first monitor.
