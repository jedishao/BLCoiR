Bug 89816  [Workbench] Cannot unlock toolbarbuild i0331-0010

I started up this build and I have the coolbar locked. But I noticed that when I
look at the coolbar context menu, the "Lock the Toolbar" item is checked but
greyed out. It doesn't seem to matter where I click to bring up the menu...the
option to unlock the toolbar is always greyed out.
