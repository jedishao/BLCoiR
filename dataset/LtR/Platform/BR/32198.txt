Bug 32198  Status line delays 'Cancel' button too muchWhen application window is used as a runnable context, 'cancel' button does not 
appear right away. Instead, it is shown when the first progress is drawn. Since 
it make take a while to call 'internalWorked', this button may not appear for 
too long an interval.

Update UI has the following problem: before connecting to the remote site, we 
spawn a thread to obtain the connection input stream. In case of a frozen 
connection, we want to allow users to return and let the stream thread die the 
natural death after a timeout. However, on our first connection attempt we 
don't move 'worked' method for enough ticks to make the 'cancel' button show, 
so users cannot cancel until we retry with another URL variant.

Cancel button should be shown right away, or users should be able to tell if 
they want it right away (but IProgressMonitor does not have any provisions for 
this type of configuration).
