Bug 162421  [FastView] 3.3. presentation: view locked after minimize - show - restoreN20061026-0010, was OK in I20061024-1200

3.3. presentation: view locked after minimize - show - restore:

- minimize view (e.g. Declarations view that shows some code)
- click on view icon to show view as a fast view
=> view behaves normally (e.g. can select text in Declarations view)

- click Restore button
=> view is restored, but does not react on mouse clicks any more
Note: only view interaction is locked, but redraw works; e.g. Declarations view is updated when another element is selected
