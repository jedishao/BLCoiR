Bug 88325  [Progress] IProgressService document enhancementsThe topmost comment on the IProgressService is speaking about IProgressManager
and looks like a typo.  it should say IProgressService

Through testing the method of the IProgressService;

busyCursorWhile
run(boolean,boolean,IRunnableWithProgress)

If the IProgressService is returned by IWorkbench, must both be called from the
UI thread.  I wonder if this means all thread running methods of the
IProgressService returned by IWorkbench must be called from the UI thread.  If
so it would be nice if the workbench specified that on its getProgressService()
method.
