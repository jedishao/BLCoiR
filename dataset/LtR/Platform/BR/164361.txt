Task name not shown in user job progress dialog3.2.
The progress dialog for a user job often does not show the task name passed to IProgressMonitor.beginTask.
This appears to be due to a race condition in the optimization in ProgressMonitorDialog that tries to avoid trimming and setting the message in the label if the dialog is not visible.  It's possible for the message to get set but never get shown, due to the SWT.Show handler running before messageLabel.isVisible() is true.

I suggest that the SWT.Show handler always set the last message in the label, even if it's not yet visible.  That is, avoid the isVisible() check in setMessage when coming from the SWT.Show handler in configureShell.

Can this get addressed for the next milestone?  I'd be happy to sit down and help with this one.
