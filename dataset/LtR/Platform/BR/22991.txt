Bug 22991  [Dialogs] FilteredList.setSelection does not work as expectedsetSelection does not work if called from the same event-handling loop as 
setElements. This is because it starts a new thread which synchronously adds
new items to the table. Thus, setSelection (which simply calls 
Table.setSelection) has no effect, since the table is empty.

The behaviour is best visible on JDT Choose Package subdialog of New Class 
dialog - the pre-selected package is allways the first one, not the one entered 
in  the box.
