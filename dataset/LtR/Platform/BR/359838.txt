Bug 359838  [workspace selection] The "Workspace Unavailable" error message does not list the workspace locationBuild Identifier: 

If the chosen workspace is locked Eclipse will not be able to use it and show an error dialog (see attachment). This dialog does report the workspace to be in use, but it does not list the workspace location.

Some users start their Eclipse with preconfigured workspaces, these users in particular would benefit from this dialog stating the workspace location again, which seems like a small and risk-free change with some value to it !:)

Let me know what you think

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Eclipse with Workspace "C:\data"
2. Start another Eclipse with the same Workspace
3. see error for the second Eclipse instance does not contain the ws location
