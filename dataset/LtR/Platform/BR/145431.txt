The list is incorrectly sorted for Danish. The bottom part of the list has the Danish letter '?' sorted after the Danish letter '?'. This is incorrect. There is also one single entry in the list which starts with a lower case letter, and this is sorted incorrectly in between 'Z' and a Danish national character.
It looks as if the sort is basic US ASCII (binary) sort, not locale-specific.

Working as designed, not even sorted in English. Thanks.

I don't agree. The list is sorted in English. You don't see upper case 'W' come before 'V' - which is exactly equivalent to the problem I have in Danish.
