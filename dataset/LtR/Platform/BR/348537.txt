Bug 348537  Add non-java package table is not selecteable when no java packages are availableMake a plug-in project
Add a package with a java file
Add two additional packages with an xml-file (non-java packages)


in the manifest editor, runtime tab, press "Add..." and add all the java packages to Exported Packages
exit the "Add..." dialog

press the "Add..." button again
the list is empty
click the "Show non-Java packages" checkbox
the two non-java packages appear but they cannot be selected

exit the dialog
remove the java package from the list

press the "Add..." button again
click the "Show non-Java packages" checkbox
the two non-java packages appear and can be selected because one or more java packages exists


The table seems to be blocked when there are no java packages in the list.
