Bug 140425  [WorkbenchParts] Closing Workspace gives "Widget disposed too early!" in logEclipse 3.2RC1a

I have not been able to reproduce this bug.

Conditions:

I have a workspace with ~30 projects in it and I was checking in changes to my CVS repository after a few hours of work.  After the checkin completed I closed the workspace and got the "there's an error message in your log" error dialog.  Then I saw the progress dialog that is usually displayed when Eclipse is closed.

When I reopened Eclipse everything was as expected.  As far as I can tell no corruption occurred.


Log Errors:

The errors in the log are a combination of the following exceptions:

org.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Graphic is disposed
java.lang.RuntimeException: Widget disposed too early!

I have attached the full log for your analysis.

I experienced a lot of connection-related exceptions with CVS because sourceforge.net was down last night for an extended period while I tried to synchronize my projects.  I'm sorry they clutter the log file but I didn't want to modify it in any way in case they are relevant.
