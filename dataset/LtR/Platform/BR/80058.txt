Bug 80058  [Wizards] Create folder blocked should avoid locking workspaceVersion 3.1.M3.

- In the Resource perspective, I did a Team/CVS Update on a large Java project
and sent it to the background.
- I then went into a different project, and tried to create a new directory from
the Navigation pane. That action was blocked.

Should I not be able to create a new folder at the same time?

Thanks,
Gary
