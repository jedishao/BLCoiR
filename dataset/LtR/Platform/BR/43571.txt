Bug 43571  Apparent deadlock when rebuilding all20030924

During a rebuild all the build process is locked at 35%

1) load in the platform-ui module and then import all other plugins 
2) Select Rebuild All
3) A progress monitor dialog comes up stating that all are being rebuilt. At 
the same time progress begins in the status line which stops at 35%. Hitting 
cancel on the dialog does nothing.
