Bug 15379  WorkingSetManager resource change listener not thread safe
Resource changes can occur in any thread, and so the resource change listener 
installed by WorkingSetManager can be called in any thread.  However, the 
ResourceNavigator listens to working set changes and tries to update its viewer, 
which can only happen in the UI thread.  The result is an illegal thread access 
exception from SWT.

To reproduce:

1) Create a java project
2) Add that project to a working set
3) Make the navigator or packages view show only that working set
4) Delete the project.
