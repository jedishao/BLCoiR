Bug 327154  [Compatibility] Synchronize with CVS triggers save on saveables even if they are not dirtyI20101001-0854

- Fresh workspace
- Check out 'o.e.ui.editors' from CVS
- Enable Save Actions : Preferences > Java > Editor > Save Actions (Format all Lines, Organize imports, Additional actions)
- Open few files in java editor (I had opened the first 5 files in the first package DefaultEncodingSupport.java, DocumentReader.java,EditorsUI.java, EncodingActionGroup.java, FileBufferOperationAction.java)
- Synchronize 'o.e.ui.editors' with CVS, you will have outgoing changes in all the open editors because of the Save Action

This does not happen with 3.x (I20101005-0800). 

Marking as major as this is just frustrating...
