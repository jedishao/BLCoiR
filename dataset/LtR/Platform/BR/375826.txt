Bug 375826  No SWT.Show event on selecting a menu from the RCP workbenchBuild Identifier: 4.2.0.v20120315-1300

We, the Jubula team, currently check the compatibility of testing 3.x
applications / plugins with e4.2 + compatibility layer and noticed that we have problems accessing menus from the Workbench and toolbar: the items / framework do not fire the SWT.Show event anymore.

To correctly synchronize with the application we make use of global filters via Display.addFilter() and SWT.Show events for menus when e.g. remote controlling those. We are using this event to check if items from the menu are shown (e.g. after a click on the menu), but for RCP workbench menus and toolbar items with sub menus these events do no longer get fired / propagated. 

This results in the problem of not being able to detect that the menu has been opened successfully, and hence cannot correctly test the workbench and toolbar item menus at all.

Does the new 4.2 UI use other events or are we missing something here?

Reproducible: Always
