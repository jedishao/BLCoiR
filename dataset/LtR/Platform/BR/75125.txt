Bug 75125  [Preferences] ScopedPreferenceStore improvements.From DJ:

1). It would be best if the silentRunning code was in a try/finally block in 
case there is a problem.
2). I think your code should only have to call #fireChange if old and new 
value are different. (unless the code does that somewhere else)
