Bug 60236  [Progress] non-responsive blocked dialogsWhen an operation is executed with IRunnableContext.run(false, false, ...) and 
a blocked dialog shows up, then the blocked dialog is not responsive since 
there is nobody to process the events. The non-responsiveness shows up as 
follows:
- the details button is not responsive
- the progress bars shown in the details area are not updated
- you cannot cancel a thread in the details area

In this situation we should disable the details button and collapse the 
details area.

To detect the forked=false case could you make the following test: 
ModalContext.isModalContextThread(Thread.currentThread(). If the current 
thread isn't the modal context thread then the operation wasn't forked.
