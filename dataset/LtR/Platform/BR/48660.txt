Bug 48660  DeferredTreeContentManager hard to reuseI20031210

If this class had the option of passing in a custom IElementCollector, it would 
be much easier to reuse for custom tree viewers.  Currently the 
IElementCollector calls a private method that cannot be overridden.  In fact, it 
is impossible to subclass this class because most of its implementation is 
private.

I am working with a user who has a custom tree viewer. He wants to make use of 
the deferred content provider infrastructure, but is blocked because there are 
no entry points for reuse.

Recommend: Extra constructor to pass a custom IElementCollector, and make all 
private methods protected.  There doesn't seem to be anything that needs to be 
hidden in this class.
