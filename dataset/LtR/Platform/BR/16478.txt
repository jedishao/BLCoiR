Bug 16478  [DND] Drag & Drop holds onto file during operationBuild: 20020519

If you overwrite a file in Eclipse using a drag & drop operation, Eclipse holds 
onto the file in the OS until autobuild completes the build.  On long builds 
this deadlocks the source navigator (blech!).

To reproduce this bug:
1. New workspace
2. Import org.apache.ant as a binary project using the plugin import wizard
3. Import all other plugins as source projects using the plugin import wizard
4. Copy the .classpath file for the org.eclipse.core.runtime plugin to an 
offshore location.
5. Edit the offshore version of the .classpath file in the OS to no longer have 
a source directory.
6. Drag the offshore version from the Windows Explorer into the 
org.eclipse.core.runtime plugin.
7. At the prompt click Yes to overwrite the file.  A long build will begin, 
meanwhile the Windows Explorer will have locked up.

Are we holding onto the file during the build?
