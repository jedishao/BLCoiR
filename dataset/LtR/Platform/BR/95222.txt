Bug 95222  [KeyBindings] Bindings stop working (no shell activation event)Build 20050513-0010
Linux-GTK

I don't have steps to reproduce yet, but while working on today's build various
keys have randomly stopped functioning. Earlier today I was trying to copy/paste
with ctrl+c/v and it wasn't working. Then I used the context menu items and it
started working again. Just now, I was trying to delete a block of text by
highlighting it and pressing backspace, but pressing backspace had no effect.
After typing in my browser window and switching back to Eclipse, the problem
went away.

It could be that the window needs to lose focus for the keys to start working
again. So maybe it's just a window focus problem.
