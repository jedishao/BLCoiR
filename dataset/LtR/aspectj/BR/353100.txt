Bug 353100  Need to demote "warning ignoring duplicate definition" from warning to debugBuild Identifier: 1.6.11

This kind of problem can occur for complex class loader hierarchies, and since it is not really a problem, we should make it debug level message so as not to write log messages un-necessarily.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an application that has some weaved class loaders hierarchy - recommend some URLClassLoader derived ones
2. Add the same(!) JAR with only an aop.xml file to more than one loader along the hierarchy
3. Make the loader the default context thread loader and start running some code.
