Race condition in PersistentTopic#addReplicationCluster.
          Describe the bug
In class org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.persistent.PersistentTopic, we have field replicators of class ConcurrentOpenHashMap.
There is a race condition in method addReplicationCluster.

It's clear that there is a race condition if multi threads would run in this code. For example
Thread A is just about to execute replicators.remove, Thread B inserts a non-null PersistentReplicator.
Then thread A will delete the PersistentReplicator which thread B just created.
And there is no other thread safe measures applied to these code.
Expected behavior
It should be thead safe.
