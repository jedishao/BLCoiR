[Proxy] Proxied /admin endpoint connections might remain blocked forever.
Describe the bug
Proxied /admin endpoint connections might remain blocked forever.
Example stacktrace
waiting to re-lock in wait() <0x00000000d3269c28> (a java.util.ArrayDeque)

Expected behavior
There should be a timeout in place which prevents threads to hang forever in this state.
When investigating the issue and code, it can be seen that the timeout isn't set for proxied requests.
The call to super.setTimeout method is missing in AdminProxyHandler. The base method is overridden and that's why it doesn't get set to any value.
this is the code in the base class method which sets the timeout:
https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/526006ecfa3af7f1a27ef3a288e2bef7ea9dd7e8/jetty-proxy/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/proxy/AbstractProxyServlet.java#L321-L324
Another observation from that code is that it has been copy-pasted from the Jetty code. There's no use of using the ServletConfig for getting the configuration values. This code need some cleanup too.
