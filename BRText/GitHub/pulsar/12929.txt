Deadlock in internalDeleteSubscription  in metadata-store callback thread.
Describe the bug
When doing certain topic operations (for e.g., delete-subscription), it can result in a deadlock metadata-store callback thread.
Please see the stack trace below.
parking to wait for  <0x00000000ffe95e98> (a java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture$Signaller)
The issue is similar to: #12726
To Reproduce
This is a race condition, I have not been able to come up with a reliable way to reproduce this.
But it is easily reproducible in a 3-node broker setup, creating and deleting topic consumers.
Expected behavior
The metadata-store callback thread should not deadlock.
