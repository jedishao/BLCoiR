PulsarKafkaProducer is not thread safe.
Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I replaced kafka client with pulsar-client-kafka, referring to this document.

Then, sending messages to multiple topics at the same time caused an exception(NullPointerException).
This exception does not occur in version 2.2.1, but does occur in version 2.3.2 and later.
I think that the change made in this PR is the cause.
Each time you send a message to a new topic, the cluster object is regenerated.
https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/v2.3.2/pulsar-client-kafka-compat/pulsar-client-kafka/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/PulsarKafkaProducer.java#L229
The javadoc states that KafkaProducer is thread safe.
https://kafka.apache.org/20/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/KafkaProducer.html
I want to use pulsar-client-kafka without modifying the code that used Kafka client.
