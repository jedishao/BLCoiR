[Proxy] Race condition in Pulsar Proxy that causes UnsupportedOperationExceptions in Proxy logs.
Describe the bug
It is common that UnsupportedOperationExceptions appear on the Proxy logs. This particular issue was reproduced very often when Geo-replication was configured between 2 clusters.

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Setup 2 Pulsar clusters and enable geo-replication in a namespace that is shared across the clusters.
Create a topic with 200 partitions in the replicated namespace.
Restart all brokers in one cluster to get the geo-replication connections to re-initialize until you have reproduced the issue in the Pulsar Proxy logs.

Expected behavior
The race conditions should be handled in Pulsar Proxy
