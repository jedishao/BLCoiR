Race condition in reconnection after managed ledger is fenced.
While checking the intermittent failures for SequenceIdWithErrorTest, I've seen that the test is failing due to a race condition involving both producer and consumer reconnecting to the broker after the topic was fenced (in the case of the test, the fencing error is purposely inject).
