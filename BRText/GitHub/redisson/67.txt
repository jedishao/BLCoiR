RedissonList concurrency problem.
How is it ever safe to rely on RedissonList.size() when each invocation can technically return a different value?
This would mean that calling subList(0, size()), or even two consecutive calls to hasNext() on the iterator (which is normally what happens) can potentially cause an exception.
