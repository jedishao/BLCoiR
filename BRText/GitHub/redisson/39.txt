Locking on Jersey
I'm trying to use Lock and Unlock on Jersey Resource.

User makes a POST request
System LOCK "A"
System does some stuff
System UNLOCK "A"
User makes another POST request
System LOCK "A"
System does some stuff
System UNLOCK "A"

The system crashes at point 6 (view attachment).
If i try to make some LOCK-UNLOCK in a while loop it works, but when i make these LOCK-UNLOCK from different Threads it does not works.
