URIBuilder seems not to be thread safe
We test this in case of a multi cluster setup and sometimes went the java.net.URL.factory to null instead of the original factory.

Scenario:
Thread 1
replaceURLFactory
currentFactory is original value
start create URL

Thread 2
replaceURLFactory
currentFactory == newFactory -> currentFactory = null
start create URL

Thread 1 and 2
restoreURLFactory
set URL.factory to null

Next “new URL(…)” from different call cause to load new handlers.
