RedissonFairLock deadlock.
Seems related to the change on #2099.
We have tried to upgrade to 3.11.2 from 3.10.7 and this behavior started occurring.

The FairLock acquired on high load system without lease time defined.

Redisson does not handle the case of Fair lock without lease time (on high load).
when many different threads are asking for the same lock key the client is stuck and no thread acquires the lock.

Steps to reproduce or test case
