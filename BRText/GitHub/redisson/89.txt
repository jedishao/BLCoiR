RedissonLock locks up
Under heavy use on production, Redisson's locks get all locked up, and the application stalls. I'm using Redisson 1.1.5
I have 1 thread locked trying to release a lock:

Also of note, I have about 30 other threads locked awaiting for a lock (a different one from the one used by the previous thread).
I checked the threads with jstack, here is the relevant output:

I checked Redis's state:


this key is the one corresponding to the thread blocked trying to release a lock.
The other threads, that are waiting for a separate lock are locked even though there is no-one taking up such lock....
