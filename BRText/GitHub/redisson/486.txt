Rlock performance issue.
Hi,
I am using reddison Rlock with a cluster setup, and sometimes I see latency( up to 1000ms) when trying to acquire the lock or unlock.
I saw this issue opened by zhxjouc (#455) with a similar problem and I am working with 2.2.13 but I am still getting latency when a thread is trying lock a key.
My code is running with Java thread pool for accessing redis, I notice that if I work with pool of size 1-2 almost no latency when getting the lock, but working with 30-50 threads cause the lock delay.
It could be thread overhead issue but I think that 1000ms is too long for that.
Any help on how can I get better performance when locking an unlocking?.

Thanks
