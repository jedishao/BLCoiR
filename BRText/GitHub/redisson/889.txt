Taking a thread dump I noticed that all EJB async threads (and some http-executor threads too) were in the same state, generating a huge queue in the async thread pool:

Thread dump for some threads (Complete thread dump can be downloaded here):

locked <f75019a> (a java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker)

it looks like that is a lock issue, but i don't know how to solve it.
