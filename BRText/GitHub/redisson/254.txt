EOFException when I use RLock with SerializationCodec
I configure Redisson to use SerializationCodec instead of default JsonJacksonCodec.
Then I run my code in environment with concurrent threads and use Lock object to sync thread.
After that I get exception and unlock only after expiration in 30 sec.
Previous major version of Redisson does't contain this issues.
Similar problem I have when I use CountDown.
