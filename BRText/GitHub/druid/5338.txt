Potential bug in HttpPostEmitter causing high CPU usage.
After upgrading to 0.11.0, some of the deployments are facing high CPU usage issue.
After taking a thread dump, it was a suspicion that emitter thread might be causing it.
To verify the issue, we added an executor in DruidCoordinator class which just keeps on emitting events in while(true) loop like this -
while (true) {
   emitter.emit(ServiceMetricEvent.builder().setDimension("dataSource", "try").build("test", 10));
}
We found that after some time, batch.tryAddEvents method always return false and the reference in concurrentBatch never changes and the while(true) loop just keeps on spinning without sending anything or creating new batch.
Still not sure why it is happening as its not happening for all deployments, might be some concurrency issue.
