Duplicate primary key errors cause TaskQueue big lock to be held for way longer than it should.
#1896 introduced an addition of e4e5f03#diff-e677e1ba7e3cf3b5b97660cfc17749beR144 which causes errors on duplicate primary key entries to be retried way more than they should.
This retry holds onto the big lock in TaskQueue while it exhausts its attempts, causing a big backlog of things wanting to use the big lock in TaskQueue
