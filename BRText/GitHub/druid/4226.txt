druid-lookups-cached-global race condition when realtime node starts.
When we spawn a new realtime node from tranquility (from storm), it takes a bit to load all the lookups (aprox 36 seconds), and during that time, the node already published the segment and queries using lookups obviously fail
This can be seen in the log of the realtime task:
later on it loads successfully (but it's 36 seconds too late :P)
