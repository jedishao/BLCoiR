Don't call HttpServer request/ws close handler holding locks
Motivation:
currently the ServerWebSocket and HttpServerRequest close handlers are called under synchronized lock of the connection.
This can create deadlocks in SockJSSocket because a SockJSSocket may uses different request/websocket (reconnects) and event loops.
Change:
when processing a Netty close event, call the close handlers in the next tick (i.e scheduled to run on context).
