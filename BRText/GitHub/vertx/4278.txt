ArrayList concurrency error when deploying the verticles
Hi
We have an intermitent problem with the startup of our applications, in a few attempts I can reproduce so it quite often to occur.

This is the error:

This is the piece of code that is triggering the concurrency error:

class: DeploymentManager
method: registerVerticleFactory
The exception is thrown by ArrayList.sort, here is the code

So from my analysis the ArrayList is being modified while it is being sorted.
We have 20 verticles in this application, so we iterate over the collection of class names and invoke the method below from

rxDeployVerticle(String name, DeploymentOptions options)
Please let me know if any additional information is required.
Thanks
