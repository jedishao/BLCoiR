Deadlock if the connection is still being used while HttpClient is closing.
This happens in Vert.x 3.2. In thread 5717, we hold the lock on HttpClientImpl.close (lock #1) and then we try to acquire a lock on ClientConnection.close (lock #2). In thread 7035, we hold a lock #2 in ClientConnection.handleClosed and try to hold a lock #1 at HttpClientImpl.checkClosed.
