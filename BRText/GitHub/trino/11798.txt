Hive locks in waiting state still held indefinitely.
Hive locks in waiting state, timestamp acquired_at would have ‘NULL’ value,  and then locks are held indefinitely.
The missing timestamp might be the cause.
Steps to reproduce:

There is an exclusive lock on the hive table (perhaps by writing data with hive/spark)
Run select query in Trino, Trino shared_read lock in waiting state due to the exclusive lock in step 1
If we cancel the Trino query, the Trino lock stays there forever in waiting state

#10401 released the locks in ACQUIRED state but didn’t release the locks in WAITING state.
The possible workaround is a script to delete the locks in Hive.
