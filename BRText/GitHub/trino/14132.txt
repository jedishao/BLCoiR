Missing manifest file when releasing Hive Metastore's the lock has failed.
HiveMetastoreTableOperations using aquireLock and releaseLock while committing to iceberg existing table.
releaseLock happens in the finally block and that step can also fail, and that result into that missing manifest file.

if HiveMetastoreTableOperations's line failed to execute at Metastore level. It can fail for Metastore timeout or if lock is missing from HMS side it can throw NoSuchLockException which is an Exception and not RuntimeException
Then after the failure, insert/select or any query on this table will fail, and table becomes unusable:

Reason would be when the release lock step was failed, the Iceberg's commit handles only RuntimeException so in case of NoSuchLockException being thrown then it has not done any step.
So, looks like the new snapshot is created and pointing to a new manifest file in the previous step, but that file is missing/not created.
