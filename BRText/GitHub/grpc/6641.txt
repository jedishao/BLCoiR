Deadlock in server transport with multiple ports.
ServerImpl.start() calls NettyServer.start() while holding ServerImpl.lock. NettyServer.start() awaits a submitted runnable in eventloop.
However, this pending runnable may never be executed because the eventloop might be executing some other task, like ServerListenerImpl.transportCreated(),  that is trying to acquire ServerImpl.lock causing a deadlock.
This is a deadlock for multiple-port server transport usecase with the same deadlock mechanism as #6601.
