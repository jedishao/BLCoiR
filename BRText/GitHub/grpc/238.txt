Race in Server handler initialization.
When initializing an incoming client connection, we call startAsync() on the transport, which registers the handler on a separate thread. This is obviously a race, and it would have probably been fixed if I had finished Service removal in #35.
Symptom:
DEBUG i.n.channel.DefaultChannelPipeline - Discarded inbound message SimpleLeakAwareByteBuf(PooledUnsafeDirectByteBuf(ridx: 0, widx: 259, cap: 1024)) that reached at the tail of the pipeline. Please check your pipeline configuration.

The quickest fix would be to call awaitRunning() from initChannel(). That reduces the rate new connections can connect, but is probably the most expedient solution, until #35 is finished.
@nmittler, thoughts?
