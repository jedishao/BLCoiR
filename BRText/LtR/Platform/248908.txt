BusyIndicator deadlocks UI thread.

I have been debugging my RCP application during a whole day to find why the application was freezing.
I like to have the BusyIndicator shown when the editor is dirty, and when i save it, the UI locked. Disabling the BusyIndicator solved my problem, i took time to test the BusyIndicator because i thought the problem can not come from the Eclipse Framework itself, but it seems it's a bug !
