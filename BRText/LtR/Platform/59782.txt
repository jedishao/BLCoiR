Deadlock in reentrant workspace.runbuild I20040420-1300.
- started eclipse in Java perspective
- I believe I selected a project in the packager explorer, then chose Window > Preferences
- when the prefs dialog came up (with the Workbench page selected), I then got a progress dialog
- it showed a waiting user operation and a waiting workspace build
