Exec command failures using Java 8 on Unix.
I'm attaching a test case that shows an issue.
I've been running into with the exec command since updating my environment to Java 8.
It appears that I’m running into a race condition where a stream is sometimes closed prematurely before DefaultExecutor has a chance to close it, causing DefaultExecCommandExecutor to throw and exit (even though the command did execute properly).
I've tested this against the updated version of commons-exec as well just to make sure this hasn't somehow been fixed in that library.
Please note that the attached test doesn‘t always fail; you may need to run it a few times before the error will show up.
