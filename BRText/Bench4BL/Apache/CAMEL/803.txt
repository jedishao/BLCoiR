ValidatingProcessor not thread-safe.
The method org.apache.camel.processor.validation.ValidatingProcessor.process() is executed concurrently but error information is stored in a shared errorHandler.
Because each thread calls errorHandler.reset() it may clean errors written by another thread.
The easiest way to fix this issue would be a synchronized block: ValidatingProcessor.java
The disadvantage of this solution is that is serializes threads. A locally created error handler would be preferrable ...
