Initialization code of camel-cxf is not thread safe.
getCxfBinding is not thread safe in case multiple threads hit a CXF webserive at once and it hasnt been initialized before.
Code like this

Is a false sense as the getAndSet will let other threads pass it with a cxfBinding that still may not have been initialized.
