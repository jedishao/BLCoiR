Setup default values for thread-connected properties in WebSocket component.
If you do not set properties minThreads or maxThreads or method getThreadPool() returns null then you will get RuntimeCamelException and websocket cosumer will not be created.
These attributes were not required in previous versions of camel. Websocket component now uses Jetty 9.
If these properties are really required why do not use some default values?
