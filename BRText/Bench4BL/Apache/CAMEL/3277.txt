Threading issue which lets converter loading abort.
The type converter loading is not threadsafe and fails sometimes.
That will end up with around 17 type converters loaded only which will probably let your camel routes fail with conversion errors like:

Tracking the issue down showed that several type converter loaders share the same registry object and fail to load all converters every once a while.
That can be fixed by making the load method synchronized...see attached patch.
