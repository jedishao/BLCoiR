JpaMessageIdRepository uses EntityManager non thread-safe.
In our product we have found strange behavior of JpaMessageIdRepository when change version 2.9.2 to 2.12.3.
The reason for this was that EntityManager assigned in the constructor org.apache.camel.processor.idempotent.jpa.JpaMessageIdRepository, but EntityManager not required to be thread safe.
I think need assign the EntityManager in each method separately.
