ConcurrentModificationException when creating dynamic routesThis ticket refers to CAMEL-7836.
The fix seems to be slightly wrong. (We still get the ConcurrentModificationException)
The cause seems to be in removeRouteCollection and addRouteCollection.

Here the code synchronizes on the routes parameter, but should be on this.routes (as it getRoutes() does).
The same in addRouteCollection().
