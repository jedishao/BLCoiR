Make initializing dag ids in TezWork thread safe for parallel compilation.
When parallel query compilation is enabled, it is possible for concurrent running threads to create TezWork objects that have the same dag id. 
This is because the counter used to obtain the next dag id is not thread safe. 
The counter should be an AtomicInteger rather than an int.
