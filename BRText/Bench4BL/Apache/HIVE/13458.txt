Heartbeater doesn't fail query when heartbeat fails.
When a heartbeat fails to locate a lock, it should fail the current query. That doesn't happen, which is a bug.
Another thing is, we need to make sure stopHeartbeat really stops the heartbeat, i.e. no additional heartbeat will be sent, since that will break the assumption and cause the query to fail.
