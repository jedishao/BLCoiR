A race condition is caused within QueryPlan classHive's threads are stopped at HashMap.getEntry(..) that is used within QueryPlan#extractCounters() and QueryPlan#updateCountersInQueryPlan().  
It seems that a race condition problem of a HashSet object is caused when extractCounters() and updateCountersInQueryPlan() are concurrently executed.  
I hit the problem with Hive 0.7.1 but, I think that it also is caused with 0.8.1.
The problem is reported by several persons on mailing list.
The following is a part of my thread dump.
