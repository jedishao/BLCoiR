insert overwrite partition deadlocks on itself with DbTxnManagerinsert overwrite ta partition(part=xxxx) select xxx from tb join ta where part=xxxx.
It seems like the Shared conflicts with the Exclusive lock for Insert Overwrite even though both are part of the same txn.
More precisely insert overwrite requires X lock on partition and the read side needs an S lock on the query.
A simpler case is insert overwrite ta partition(part=xxxx) select * from ta.
