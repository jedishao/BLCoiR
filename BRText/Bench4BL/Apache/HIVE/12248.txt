The rawStore used in DBTokenStore should be thread-safe.
A non-thread-safe implementation of RawStore, particularly ObjectStore, set in DBTokenStore is being shared by multi-threads, which causes the race condition in DataNuclues to access the backend DB. 
The DN PersistenceManager(PM) in ObjectStore is not thread safe, so DBTokenStore should use a ThreadLocal ObjectStore.
Following errors might be root caused by the race condition in DN PM.
