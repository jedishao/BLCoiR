DelegationTokenSecretManager reuses the same objectstore, which has concurrency issues.
sometime in metastore log, will get below exception, after analysis, we found that :
when hivemetastore start, the DelegationTokenSecretManager will maintain the same objectstore, see here
saslServer.startDelegationTokenSecretManager(conf, *baseHandler.getMS()*, ServerMode.METASTORE);
this lead to the cocurrent issue.
