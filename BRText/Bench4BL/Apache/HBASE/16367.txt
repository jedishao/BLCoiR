Race between master and region server initialization may lead to premature server abort.
I was troubleshooting a case where hbase (1.1.2) master always dies shortly after start - see attached master log snippet.
It turned out that master initialization thread was racing with HRegionServer#preRegistrationInitialization() (initializeZooKeeper, actually) since HMaster extends HRegionServer.
Through additional logging in master:

I found that execution didn't reach the last log line before region server declared cluster Id being null.
