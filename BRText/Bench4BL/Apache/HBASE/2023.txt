Client sync block can cause 1 thread of a multi-threaded client to block all others.
Take a highly multithreaded client, processing a few thousand requests a second. 
If a table goes offline, one thread will get stuck in "locateRegionInMeta" which is located inside the following sync block:
So when other threads need to find a region (EVEN IF ITS CACHED!!!) it will encounter this sync and wait. 
This can become an issue on a busy thrift server (where I first noticed the problem), one region offline can prevent access to all other regions!
Potential solution: narrow this lock, or perhaps just get rid of it completely.
