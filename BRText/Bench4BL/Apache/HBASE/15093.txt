Replication can report incorrect size of log queue for the global source when multiwal is enabled.
Replication can report incorrect size for the size of log queue for the global source when multiwal is enabled. 
This happens because the method MetricsSource#setSizeofLogQueue performs non-trivial operations in a multithreaded world, even though it is not synchronized. 
We can simply divide MetricsSource#setSizeofLogQueue into MetricsSource#incrSizeofLogQueue and MetricsSource#decrSizeofLogQueue.
Not sure why we are currently directly setting the size instead of incrementing/decrementing it.
