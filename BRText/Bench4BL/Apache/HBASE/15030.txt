Deadlock in master TableNamespaceManager while running IntegrationTestDDLMasterFailover.
I was running IntegrationTestDDLMasterFailover on distributed cluster when i notice this.
Here is relevant part of master's jstack:

"ProcedureExecutor-3":

  waiting for ownable synchronizer 0x000000072574b330, (a java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock$NonfairSync),
  which is held by "ProcedureExecutor-1"

"ProcedureExecutor-1":
  waiting to lock monitor 0x00007fd2cc328908 (object 0x0000000725c36a48, a org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.TableNamespaceManager),

  which is held by "ProcedureExecutor-3"

Java stack information for the threads listed above:



Found 1 deadlock.


I will try to dig more info about why this happened logs not showing much.
