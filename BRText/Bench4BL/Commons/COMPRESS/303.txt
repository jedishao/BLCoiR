Restore immutability/thread-safety to CompressorStreamFactory.
CompressorStreamFactory was immutable prior to 1.5; r1453945 broke immutability. 
It's also no longer thread-safe because the field decompressConcatenated is not safely published.
It would be possible to make it thread-safe by making the field volatile.
It could be made conditionally immutable by using the same technique as suggested in COMPRESS-302, in preparation for removing the method setDecompressConcatenated in a future API-break release.
