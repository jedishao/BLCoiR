FileCleaner thread never ends and cause memory leak in ASFileCleaner opens a thread and The no solution is given to the user to end it.
So when an application is undeployed in an Application Server, a thread is still alive. 
The WebApp can't be undeployed and this results in a classloader leak that will cause an OutOfMemoryError.
I think the API should be extended so that a user can end the thread.
A better way would be to provide a class that cleans everything for commons IO.
