Deadlock during refresh properties.
Hi,
Commons configurations get itself stuck in deadlock when refreshing properties using Managed reloading strategy. 
It seems to me it gets stuck because of fireEvent in reload method.
Another access grabs lock on synchronized (getNodeCombiner()) when trying to rebuild but Combined configuration is one of the listeners for event es well and it gets stuck when processing invalidate. 
Can anyone suggest quick fix please?
Relevant information follows.
Thanks
Pavel
