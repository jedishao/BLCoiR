Issue in HashCodeBuilder which only shows up under high load multi-threaded usage.
We found we were having problems with HashCodeBuilder under multi-threaded high load.
I narrowed this down to the following attached test case.
When I dug into the code, I found the problem was solved by commenting out the isRegistered method (though this would break the infinite loop problem).
(I did a lot of other digging that I wont bore you with).
So instead I replaced the HashSet with an ArrayList and just added the object, rather than the toIdentityHashCodeInteger(object).
This results in about 5 lines of change.  
My suspicion is that System.identityHashCode does not return unique values (it is after all a hashcode method).  
The code assumes it will return a unique value and this causes the problem at high loads.
The downside is a List vs. a Set, but I believe this is necessary.
I'd like to submit this fix and have it verified (and perhaps improved).  
I am convinced it is a necessary fix which we have seen show up under high loads.
Kindest regards, 
Andrew.
