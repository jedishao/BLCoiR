AbstractUserDetailsAuthenticationProvider makes two hits when no cache is used.
If you look at AbstractUserDetailsAuthenticationProvider.authenticate, you'll notice that in case of failure, Acegi suppose that it is due to a cache synchronization problem and make a second retrieveUser.
But if you use no cache, your information were already up to date and retrieveUser is still called...
I think that this snippet (l. 148-151):
cacheWasUsed = false;
user = retrieveUser(username, (UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken) authentication);
additionalAuthenticationChecks(user, (UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken) authentication);
has to be changed to that :

It'll avoid an useless double check...
