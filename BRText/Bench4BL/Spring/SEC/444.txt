Race condition inside ConcurrentSessionControllerImpl.
I was getting SessionAlreadyUsedException on rapid usage (by single user). The strack trace of the exception is below.

            sessionRegistry.removeSessionInformation(sessionId);
            sessionRegistry.registerNewSession(sessionId, principal);
The registerNewSession() will fail if an other thread registers the same session between these two commands.
