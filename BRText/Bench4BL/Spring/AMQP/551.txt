Intermittent build failure caused by non-thread-safe use of MockitoLocalizedQueueConnection
FactoryTests.testFailOver uses a Mockito mock on multiple threads (it changes the mock&amp;apos;s behaviour while the listener container is running and calling the mock to cause the container to fail over). 
This leads to intermittent test failures as Mockito does not support such multi-threaded usage. The failure is:

If you're unsure why you&amp;apos;re getting above error read on.

Due to the nature of the syntax above problem might occur because:

1. This exception *might* occur in wrongly written multi-threaded tests.

Please refer to Mockito FAQ on limitations of concurrency testing.


2. A spy is stubbed using when(spy.foo()).then() syntax. It is safer to stub spies - 
with doReturn|Throw() family of methods. More in javadocs for Mockito.spy() method.

Boolean cannot be returned by toString()

toString() should return String
