ConcurrentModificationException with publish confirms.
I'm getting random ConcurrentModificationExceptions in the publish confirm code when sending messages from multiple threads, using the same rabbit template.
Looking at the code, it seems that PublisherCallbackChannelImpl.addPendingConfirm() is thread unsafe. 
It should synchronize the access to this.pendingConfirms, just like processAck() does. 
I've attached a possible fix.
