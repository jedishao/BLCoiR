Potential concurrency issues in RepositoriesgetRepoInfoFor() is iterating over the key set of the repositories already cached to eagerly return RepositoryInformation instances found upfront. 
A second thread might have already passed that block of the code and triggered lookupRepositoryFactoryInformationFor() which writes into the repositories instance variable. 
This will cause a ConcurrentModificationException as reported in this issue.
