Two concurrent threads in an expression of a flow override the rootobject of evaluation contextWhen two concurrent threads are evaluating an expression contained in a flow, the evaluation context linked to the expression can be overriden by multiple threads.
Result is in most of cases NullPointerException in a getValueInternal of classes from org.springframework.expression.spel.ast package (like PropertyOrFieldReference for example).
Wrong code seems to be in org.springframework.binding.expression.spel.SpringELExpression :

As the SpringElExpression is unique for the expression to be evaluated, it's not thread safe when updating the evaluation context with root object.
Synchronize this method resolves problem.
