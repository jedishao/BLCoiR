Unable to specify Ordering Policy for Serial GW Sender.
When a Serial GW Sender has more than 1 dispatcher-threads configured, order-policy is needed to assure correct queue selection of updates (thus assuring ordered delivery over the WAN based on application requirements).  
The GemFire documentation states:
(For serial gateway senders only.)
Whether to use multiple dispatcher threads on each gateway queue to process the queue's events. The dispatcher-threads attribute of the gateway sender determines whether multiple threads process the queue.
If you use multiple dispatcher threads, also configure the ordering policy to use for dispatching the events.
Startup Error is:
Error creating bean with name "toGrid2SenderSerial": Invocation of init method failed; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: specifying an order policy requires the parallel property to be true.
