Transaction Synchronization registration issue with injected JMSContext.
The JMSContextProducer registers a tx Synchronization object directly on the Transaction. 
That leads to issue when other parts register other Synchronization objects later on.
The JSMContextProducer must switch to using TransactionSynchronizationRegistry instead to register syncs.
