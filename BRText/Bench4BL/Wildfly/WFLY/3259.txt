Race condition in built-in ServletContextListeners.
WeldComponentIntegrationProcessor properly adds service dependency on the WeldStartService. 
This however does not happen for built-in components e.g. Mojarra's com.sun.faces.config.ConfigureListener which does use CDI. As a result, the deployment may fail depending on timing of WeldStartService and UndertowDeploymentService.
