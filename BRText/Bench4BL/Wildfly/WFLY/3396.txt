NPE in TimerResourceDefinition.
I am experiencing race conditions when running test remotely from Arquillian to Wildfly 8.1.0.CR2. 
In 2 of 3 Cases i get a NPE in Wildfly in relation to one of my own scheduled EJB.
Stacktrace:

My scheduled Service FileDeploymentScanner is somewhat special, it schedules the times itself (No Schedule annotation.
Simplified it looks like this:

What is happening, is, the arquillian client apparently tries to read complete wildfly configuration (dont know why), and during this step it fails to do so.
I failed to write reproducer ear/app. I can't release my closed source though which produces this error.
But hopefully, this NPE is easy to fix.
