Performance: DataSourceProxy#createPool should use more fine grained synchronisation
Hello,
I don't know if this is the right component.
My Enhancement concerns new Tomcat JDBC POOL.
Looking at code I think that DataSourceProxy#createPool should not be synchronized but use another private method that is synchronized and used only when creation is needed, something like that:
Currently since createPool() is called for lots of getters we get this synchro IMPACT without really needing it.
