McastServiceImpl executor is not dispatching events.
Fix proposal
The class McastServiceImpl does not dispatch events, because the executor is not creating threads.
The class ReceiverBase has its own queue to address this issue.
I have refactored the code a little to reuse the class.
I'm not sure if filing a bug in Bugzilla is the right procedure for Trunk branch.
If not, could you please tell me how should I proceed?
