Field "org.apache.catalina.tribes.transport.bio.util.FastQueue.enabled" should be volatile.
The boolean flag "org.apache.catalina.tribes.transport.bio.util.FastQueue.enabled" may be read/written by multiple threads concurrently (See <http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/!svn/bc/1203897/tomcat/trunk/java/org/apache/catalina/tribes/group/interceptors/MessageDispatchInterceptor.java>).
Therefore, accesses to it should be properly synchronized.
It is sufficient to make this boolean flag volatile to protect access to it.
