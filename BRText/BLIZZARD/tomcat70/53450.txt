Deployment of an application with 'ROOT' context hangs forever.
Hi,
The scenario is the following:
- I have running Tomcat 7.0.28
- I deploy an application with 'ROOT' context
- The deployment hangs forever.
When taking a tread dump, the following is suspicious:
- parking to wait for  <0x00000007d80f0108> (a java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock$NonfairSync)
As you can see
- A read lock is acquired at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.fireContainerEvent(ContainerBase.java:1425)
- Then every listener is invoked to process the container event
- Then AccessLogListener is invoked org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngine$AccessLogListener.uninstall(StandardEngine.java:463)
- The latter causes a call for a write lock org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.removeContainerListener(ContainerBase.java:1071)
- Unfortunately in the ReentrantReadWriteLock it is stated that upgrade from read to write lock is not possible
"Reentrancy also allows downgrading from the write lock to a read lock, by acquiring the write lock, then the read lock and then releasing the write lock.
However, upgrading from a read lock to the write lock is not possible."
Regards
