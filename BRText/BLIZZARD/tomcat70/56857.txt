Thread safety issue in ApplicationContextFacade.invokeMethod.
Multiple subsequent Thread dumps were exhibiting lots of threads hanging in HashMap.get() while in RUNNABLE status, and consuming high CPU - a typical indicator of a thread safety issue with these non-threadsafe Maps.
Thread stacks all as below.
ApplicationContextFacade implements ServletContext, these objects are singletons per webapp, and get passed around among multiple threads.
Their private member "objectCache" is a HashMap, i.e. not thread safe, but gets accessed AND modified without any synchronization in invokeMethod().
Suggested remedy: change to a ConcurrentHashMap, which is thread-safe, and performs much better than synchronizing on every access.
