ChunkedInputFilter is not recycled for servlet 3.0 asynchronous request.
The server side code is something like the following:
The InputStream returns 0 bytes for the HTTP post with chunking.
After debugging, I found that the ChunkedInputFilter is reused by org.apache.coyote.http.AbstractInputBuffer.
But it has never been recycled (nextRequest()?) before the reuse for another request.
As a result, the endChunk flag is always true after the first request.
And it always return immediately without reading more from the buffer.
