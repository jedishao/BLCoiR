javax.el.CompositeELResolver synchronization issue.
Synchronize change in CompositeELResolver.add.
The javax.el.CompositeELResolver.add method needs to synchronize around the update to the resolvers.
Also, it makes sense to increase the default size of the ELResolver array since even the jasper EL adds 5 ELResolvers.
I propose a default of 8.
