java.lang.IllegalStateException: Calling [asyncComplete()] is not valid for a request with Async state [MUST_DISPATCH].
The issue appears if the response has been set before startAsync:
response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_BAD_REQUEST);
AsyncContext asyncContext = request.startAsync(request, response);
asyncContext.dispatch();
You might wonder why would anyone do that? The actual scenario is a bit more complex.
It involves a separate thread that completes very fast, even before startAsync is called.
The resulting stack trace:
The Servlet spec says: "It is illegal to call startAsync if ..., or if the response has been committed and closed, ...".
If that is indeed the reason, a clear error should be raised, and startAsync not be allowed to proceed.
Or perhaps it is an issue that can be fixed? For what it's worth it actually works in Jetty even though the spec says it is illegal.
