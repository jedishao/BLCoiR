Editor computing AST twice concurrently.
I did open type, and it was taking a long time to open the editor after I clicked finish.
I produced a stack dump while I was waiting, and I noticed that there are two threads creating an AST at the same time.
Presumably they are even generating the same AST.
It would be good to avoid creating the same AST multiple times when the editor is first opened.
