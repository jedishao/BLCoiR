ImageDescriptorRegistry.hookDisplay() causes SWT Invalid thread access.
Eclipse Kepler
There appears to be a case where NewJavaProjectWizardPageTwo causes an SWT Invalid Thread Access when using Bndtools.
This problem has been reproduced by others.
To reproduce, create a new workspace, switch to the Bndtools perspective, create a new Bndtools OSGi project.
You should get the Invalid Thread Access.
The workaround is to delete the project you just created and create it again.
I believe the key here is that you have a brand new workspace.
Here is the stack trace.
