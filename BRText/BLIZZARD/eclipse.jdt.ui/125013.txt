deadlock in PreferencesAdapter.firePropertyChangeEvent.
- the trace shows that the syncExec call from PreferenceForwarder waits forever while holding the JavaModelManager waited for by the main thread
-> the main thread waits for the lock
-> the reconciler waits forever and is never woken up by the main thread
-> Not exactly a deadlock, but similar in result.
