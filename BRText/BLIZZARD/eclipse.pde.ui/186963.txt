ConcurrentModificationException.
Installed in addition to Eclipse-SDK: CDT-4.0RC0, EMF-2.3.0M7, Releng.Tools
Here's what I did:
* Synchronize workspace (the .exsd in question was not affected),
choose run in background
* Look at some diffs found by synchronize
* Switch to PDE Perspective
* Ctrl+Shift+R, type "subsystemconfigurations" --> brings up my file, subsystemconfigurations.exsd
--> PDE Schema Editor is opened, I see a dialog about the ConcurrentModificationException
