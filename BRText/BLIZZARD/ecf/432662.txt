ECFRuntimeException: Unable to instantiate schemes for HttpClient.
In my multi-threaded application I get many exceptions like the following for a short period after startup:
org.eclipse.ecf.core.util.ECFRuntimeException: Unable to instantiate schemes for HttpClient.

Finding the cause was a little difficult because ECFRuntimeException.printStackTrace() doesn't show the nested causes, but I found the cause nevertheless.
It's in org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.filetransfer.httpclient.Activator: The method is not thread-safe.
Adding a "synchronized" modifier solves the problem.
I noticed that the getLogService() method might suffer from the same problem, but if so it didn't manifest itself for me.
I used org.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.httpclient4_1.0.300.v20140228-1838 and found that the bug is still present in the master branch.
