Illegal thread state when debugging to conditional BP on startup.
* condition is i == 57
* change to Java perspective
* shutdown workspace
* restart workspace
* re-launch last (debug mode)
* Error dialog appears claiming a runtime exception occurred in the condition.
The error dialog appears 4 to 6 times (stacked) and this is in the log:
Terminating and restarting the target works OK.
Seems to be a problem with evaluating the condition on startup.
