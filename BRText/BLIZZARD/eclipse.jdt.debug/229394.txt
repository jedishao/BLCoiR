NPE from JFace when using cell editor in variables view.
Steps do not consistently reproduce, but I have encontered the NPE multiple times while debugging.
Possible race condition in JFace.
There is a null check before the NPE location, but another thread could call dispose.
1) Run a java program with an array of chars.
2) Stop on a breakpoint, display the array of chars in the var view.
3) Select an array entry's value in the var view to open cell editor
4) Delete the value
5) Click outside of the cell
6) Two errors, first error (Invalid Type) is correct, second is NPE
Error
Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-in: "org.eclipse.jface".
