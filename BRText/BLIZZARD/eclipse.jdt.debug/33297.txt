Unneccessary error logging from detail formatter manager.
There are two places in the detail formatter manager where errors are logged and displayed to the user when a 'toString()' evaluation fails.
Since the error is displayed to the user, we do not need to log the errors.
We currently do not log "thread not suspended errors", but no errors need to be logged.
