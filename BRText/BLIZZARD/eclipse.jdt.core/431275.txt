Deadlock in JavaModelManager$PerProjectInfo and DeltaProcessingState.
An adopter product (IBM) than runs in headless mode is hitting a deadlock with monitors org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.JavaModelManager$PerProjectInfo and org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.DeltaProcessingState.
This product started to hit this deadlock with JDT 3.6.50.v_B79_R36x_J7 (org.eclipse.jdt.core_3.6.50.v_B79_R36x_J7.jar).
They did not see this deadlock when they were using 3.6.4.v_A79_R36x (org.eclipse.jdt.core_3.6.4.v_A79_R36x).
I noticed that the patch in bugzilla https:..bugs.eclipse.org.bugs.show_bug.cgi?id=338006 was put into the stream between those two versions (although the bugzilla was targeted to 3.7.
maybe was backported), and the code added there appears in all the stack traces I have collected (specifically, the call to the new method DeltaProcessor.addPackageFragmentRoot in DeltaProcessor.addToParentInfo).
BTW, I compared the code with the latest code in master, and the code path involved in these stacks has not changed, so I believe this could happen in master as well.
Below are the stack traces.
