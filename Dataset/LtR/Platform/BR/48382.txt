Deadlock running automated testsI20031209.
The automated tests for this build failed due to a deadlock.  The stack trace is attached.
All of the jobs involved are from the new marker view work.
The problematic pattern is in Worker-4 and Worker-1, both of which are trying to join another job while owning an ILock.
I recommend releasing the ILock before attempting to join the job.
