Renderer does not synchronize ToolItem selection state with MToolItem.
Build: I20100318-2100.

I have an app with an MToolBar defining a set of tool items of type "radio".
When I select a different tool item, the button states change.
Upon quitting the application, however, the change of state is not written to the delta.
As a result, when running the application again, the toolbar item states are not what they should be.
