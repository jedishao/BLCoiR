Data race PolynomialUtils::buildPolynomial.
If you run PolynomialUtilsTest methods concurrently there will occur problem with ComparisonFailure due to incorrect building of coefficient list. 
https://github.com/apache/commons-math/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math4/analysis/polynomials/PolynomialsUtils.java#L368 should be in synchronized block. 
Explanation: polynomial of given degree can be created by other thread  and when primary thread access synchronized block, there is already created coefficients for this degree, therefore no coefficients should be added to coefficients list.
