TestUtils is thread-hostile.
TestUtils has several mutable static fields which are not synchronised, or volatile.
If one of the fields is updated by thread A, there is no guarantee that thread B will see the full update - it may see a partially updated object.
Furthermore, at least some of the static fields reference a mutable object, which can be changed whilst another thread is using it.
As far as I can tell, this class must only ever be used by a single thread otherwise the results will be unpredictable.
