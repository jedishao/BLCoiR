Delete files quietly when an exception is thrown during initialization.
LockableFileWriter fails to report lock file deletion failure - it calls lockFile.delete() several times but fails to check the return code.
N.B. IIRC, file.delete() returns false if there was no file to delete, so any fix needs to take this into account.
