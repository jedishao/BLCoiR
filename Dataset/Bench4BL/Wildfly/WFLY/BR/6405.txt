Performance: WeldDeployment.getBeanDeploymentArchive method is synchronized(Wildfly 10.0.0.FINAL).
During the performance test of my app (50 concurrent users with jmeter). 
I am running into the following issue:
There are locked threads in the method WeldDeployment.getBeanDeploymentArchive(). 
Looking the code, this method is synchronized, so it makes sense. 
The question is, is this the expected behavior or this is a bug. 
In both cases is there any workaround to overcome this limitation?
