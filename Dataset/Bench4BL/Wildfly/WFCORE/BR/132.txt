BoundedQueueThreadPoolWriteAttributeHandler does not deal with undefined core-threads correctly.
BoundedQueueThreadPoolWriteAttributeHandler doesn't deal with undefined values for core-threads correctly. 
It assumes the attribute will be defined, and that's not required.
The attribute doesn't have a fixed default value. 
Instead, the behavior in add is to set the runtime value to match max-threads of core-threads is undefined. 
BoundedQueueThreadPoolWriteAttributeHandler should do the same.
