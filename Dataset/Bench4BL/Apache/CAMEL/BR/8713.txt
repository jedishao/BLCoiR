ParallelAggregate option when using parallel mode does not run in parallel.
See CAMEL-7521
When using parallel processing then the boss thread aggregate on the fly is a single threaded boss thread that controls the aggregation. So even if setting parallel aggregate = true, then its still only 1 boss thread.
We should have a thread pool (or allow to use the existing pool for parallel processing) for worker threads to do the aggregate work in parallel.
