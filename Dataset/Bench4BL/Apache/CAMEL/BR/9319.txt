SshClient resource leak when used from ProducerTemplate.
When using ProducerTemplate for execution of an ssh command (i.e. producerTemplate.requestBody("ssh://...", String.class)), 11 threads are being created, that are never killed. Any subsequent calls create new threads, eventually this exhausts memory and thread resources on the machine.
These threads are not being killed even when explicitly stopping the ProducerTemplate.
Here is a more detailed discussion, together with profiler results and code to reproduce the issue:
