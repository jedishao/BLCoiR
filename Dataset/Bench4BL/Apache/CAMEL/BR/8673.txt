ConcurrentModificationException when creating dynamic routesThis ticket refers to CAMEL-7836.
The fix seems to be slightly wrong. (We still geht the ConcurrentModificationException)
The cause seems to be in removeRouteCollection and addRouteCollection. See here:



void removeRouteCollection(Collection&lt;Route&gt; routes) {

        synchronized (routes) {

            this.routes.removeAll(routes);

        }

}



Here the code synchronizes on the routes parameter, but should be on this.routes (as it getRoutes() does). The same in addRouteCollection().
