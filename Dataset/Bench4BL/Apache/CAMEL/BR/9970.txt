CamelFileLength header is wrong for long write fileGiven a long write file slowfile.dat. 
Camel polls the file and stores its parameters (length, lastModified...). Camel tries to get exclusive read lock and fails as file is writing by someone, next time Camel gets lock. But file was changed and its parameters are wrong.
The solution is pretty simple - check the file length and lastModified when exclusive read lock is granted and update them.
