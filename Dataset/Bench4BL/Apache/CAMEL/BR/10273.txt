[Jetty] missing jmx object if custom thread pool is used.
If a custom configuration for the ThreadPool is passed, the correspondent JMX object is not published.
The issue here is that enableJmx(), https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/camel-2.17.3/components/camel-jetty-common/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/jetty/JettyHttpComponent.java#L314
that adds the mbeans listeners is called only after setThread https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/camel-2.17.3/components/camel-jetty-common/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/jetty/JettyHttpComponent.java#L1177 method, so this explains how come the threadpool is not exposed on JMX.
I've put a simple PR that just adds a check for enableJmx flag at component level, but I wonder if I should make it smarter to take in account possible settings only at Endpoint level or instead if we should remove it the flag per Endpoint altogether.
