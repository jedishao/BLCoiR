JettyHttpProducer.doStop does not stop client thread poolCase:
CamelContext with one route:
from("direct:a")
 .routingSlip(generateHttpUrl())
Where generateHttpUrl() returns  for example:
"jetty:http://someurl.com:666/some?httpClientMinThreads=128&amp;"
When CamelContext is closing, JettyHttpProducer.doStop is not called.
Result:

When JettyHttpProducer.client is closing, its thread pool is not closed and the threads are non-deamon threads (subject to another JIRA),  so application cannot be shutdown.
