Initialization code of camel-cxf is not thread safe.
getCxfBinding is not thread safe in case multiple threads hit a CXF webserive at once and it hasnt been initialized before.
Code like this

    public CxfBinding getCxfBinding() {
        if (cxfBinding == null) {
            cxfBinding = new DefaultCxfBinding();   
            if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
                LOG.debug("Create default CXF Binding " + cxfBinding);
            }
        }
        
        if (!cxfBindingInitialized.getAndSet(true) 
                &amp;&amp; cxfBinding instanceof HeaderFilterStrategyAware) {
            ((HeaderFilterStrategyAware)cxfBinding)
                .setHeaderFilterStrategy(getHeaderFilterStrategy());
        }
        return cxfBinding;
    }


Is a false sense as the getAndSet will let other threads pass it with a cxfBinding that still may not have been initialized.
