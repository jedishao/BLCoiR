Concurrency issue with the dynamic router.
We have a service with two HTTP contexts:
http://0.0.0.0:9000/endpoin1/dynamic"
http://0.0.0.0:9000/endpoin2/dynamic"
Both endpoints can be called using a HTTP GET method and a dynamic router routes the message differently.
Each HTTP endpoint  has its own instance of the dynamic router bean. The dynamic router bean does not use any shared state.
When the HTTP endpoints are called sequentially the calls are handled as expected. When the HTTP endpoints are called concurrently then sometimes the the dynamic router of the 9000/endpoin1/dynamic endpoint is re-routing calls originating from 9000/endpoin2/dynamic and vice versa.
Please take a look at attached unit test case for more detail.
