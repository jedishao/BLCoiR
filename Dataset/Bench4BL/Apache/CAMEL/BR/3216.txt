ScheduledPollConsumer should avoid runnable thread to die to ensure its kept being scheduledscheduled consumers such as file/ftp uses ScheduledPollConsumer to poll. 
If a throwable is thrown then the thread may die due it throws that to the JDK.
We should avoid this and ensure to catch all exceptions, otherwise the thread may die, and the JDK will not re-schedule a new thread.
This cause it to stop polling.
