Replication queue's lock will live forever if RS acquiring the lock has died prematurelyIn default, we will use multi operation when we claimQueues from ZK. 
But if we set hbase.zookeeper.useMulti=false, we will add a lock first, then copy nodes, finally clean old queue and the lock. 
However, if the RS acquiring the lock crash before claimQueues done, the lock will always be there and other RS can never claim the queue.
