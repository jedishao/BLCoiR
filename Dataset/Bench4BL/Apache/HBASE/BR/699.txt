Fix TestMigrate up on HudsonIts hanging on hudson again.
Caught a threaddump.
Its that old waiting on a vanished unix process... no hbase threads hanging out.
I tried adding relocateRegion just before taking out scan in verify.  
That was good for fixing the first region in the table.  
We hung when we tried to get second region. It was trying to go to old address.
