When client exists abnormally, it doesn't release ACID locks
if you start Hive CLI (locking enabled) and run some command that acquires locks and C the shell before command completes the locks for the command remain until they timeout.
I believe Beeline has the same issue.
Need to add proper hooks to release locks when command dies. (As much as possible)
