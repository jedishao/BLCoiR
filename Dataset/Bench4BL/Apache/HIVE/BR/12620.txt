Misc improvement to Acid module.
DbLockManger.unlock() - if this fails (due to no such lock in turn due to timeout) the lock is not removed from DbLockManger internal tracking.
Add logic to DBLockManager to detect if there is attempt to interleave transactions or locks from different statements for read-only auto commit mode.
TxnHandler.checkLock() can use 1 connection instead of 2.
TxnHandler.timeOutLocks() - refactor so that it can log which locks were expired (simplifies debugging).
TxnHandler#getTxnIdFromLockId() - include lock id if it's not found.
TxnHandler#checkRetryable() - log exception it saw.
TxnHandler.lock() - throw new MetaException("Couldn&amp;apos;t find a lock we just created!"); - include lockid.
