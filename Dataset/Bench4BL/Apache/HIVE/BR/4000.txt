Hive client goes into infinite loop at 100% cpu.
The Hive client starts multiple threads to track the progress of the MapReduce jobs. 
Unfortunately those threads access several static HashMaps that are not protected by locks. 
When the HashMaps are modified, they sometimes cause race conditions that lead to the client threads getting stuck in infinite loops.
