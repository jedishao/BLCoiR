HiveTxnManager.acquireLocks() should not block foreverCurrently, in DbTxnManager this method will block until all competing locks have gone away.
This is not appropriate for all clients.  There should be a way to specify a max-wait-time.
It will throw an exception on timeout (given how current method signature is written).
