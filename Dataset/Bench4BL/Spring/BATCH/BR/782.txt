Synchronization issue in ItemOrientedStep if exception is throw in chunk processing.
I have read source code of 1.0.x and 1.1.x and both share similar problem.
In ItemOrientedStep:
Code:
protected ExitStatus doExecute(final StepExecution stepExecution) throws Exception {
    // blablabla
    return stepOperations.iterate(new RepeatCallback() {
        public ExitStatus doInIteration(RepeatContext context) throws Exception {
            // balblabla
            try {
                // Process chunk .... (1)
                try 
{
                    synchronizer.lock(stepExecution);
                }
                catch (InterruptedException e) 
{
                    stepExecution.setStatus(BatchStatus.STOPPED);
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
                // step execution persistence
            }
            catch (Error e) 
{
                processRollback(stepExecution, contribution, fatalException, transaction);
                throw e;
            }
            catch (Exception e) {                processRollback(stepExecution, contribution, fatalException, transaction);                throw e;            }
            finally 
{
                synchronizer.release(stepExecution);
            }
            //blblabla
            return exitStatus;
        }
    });
}
In case of any exception occured in (1) or during synchronizer.lock(), the internal semaphore in synchronizer is NOT acquired. 
However, the outer final block releases synchronizer, and hence, releasing the semaphore.
From JDK API of 1.5, it stated that Semaphore can be released by another thread which is not the original acquirer of semaphore.
So, in case of parallel processing, I may goes into some case:
Thread 1 acquired the semaphore and doing those step execution persistence stuff.
Thread 2 have exception in processChunk, and hence releasing the semaphore.
Thread 3, originally waiting for semaphore, is now acquired the semaphore because Thread 2 releases it, and hence, it goes to the peresistence block of code.
In such case, Thread 1 and 3 goes into the should-be-protected block of code for step execution persistence.
In my environment, I throwed an exception in my writer, and it caused this exception:
[ERROR] SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor-1 [step.AbstractStep] Encountered an error executing the step
org.springframework.batch.core.step.AbstractStep$FatalException: Fatal error detected during save of step execution context
// stack trace deleted
Caused by: org.springframework.dao.OptimisticLockingFailureException: Attempt to update step execution id=609 with wrong version (5), where current version is 4
// stack trace deleted
It is caused by concurrent access and persistence of step execution because of the above mentioned issue.  
Upon happening, in DB, the step execution will be updated with UNKNOWN status, and hence, preventing it from re-run.
A quick fix is to set a flag after synchronizer lock, and only release if flag is set.  
However it does not cater for interruption exception during synchronizer locking.
