Memory leak in web deployments because ThreadLocal is not nulled out in ChunkMonitor.
The Tomcat leak detection in 6.0.24 caught this one: 
it's a tiny leak but the thread local in ChunkMonitor is not nulled out so re-deployment of a web application can result in a memory leak.  
Tomcat fixes it (from 6.0.24) so it's probably not a big deal for existing users.
