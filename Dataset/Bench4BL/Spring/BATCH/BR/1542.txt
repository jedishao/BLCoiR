Thread safety in JobExecution and StepExecution collections.
The collections inside JobExecution and StepExecution should have copy-on-write concurrency protection.  
The only place we are likely to see the effect is in really fast step and job executions using the MapJobRepository (which is only thread safe since BATCH-1541 anyway).
