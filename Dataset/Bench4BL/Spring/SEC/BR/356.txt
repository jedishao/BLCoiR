Changes to Authentication leak into synchronous requests when using HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter.
HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter will read an existing SecurityContext object from the session and attach it to the Http request thread by calling: SecurityContextHolder#setContext. 
This means that simultaneous requests get the same SecurityContext object. 
If one of those threads changes the authentication attached to the context (for example, to enable some "Run As" functionality such as in org.acegisecurity.intercept.AbstractSecurityInterceptor) that authentication will be seen to change in all the request threads and may enable those threads to be able to gain access that they shouldn't have.
