Concurrent/ThreadPoolTaskScheduler don't work with DelegatingSecurityContextExecutorWe have a setup with Spring Boot with scheduling. 
To use method security with background jobs we want to use the DelegatingSecurityContextScheduledExecutorService like described here: http://www.petrikainulainen.net/programming/spring-framework/spring-from-the-trenches-invoking-a-secured-method-from-a-scheduled-job/ (see "Spring Security 3.2: It Is Almost Like Magic!").
I suspect this stopped working with SEC-3031, because now DelegatingSecurityContextRunnable/Callable doesn't set/clear the security context if run on the same thread as they were created.
As Concurrent/TheadPoolTaskScheduler uses a ReschedulingRunnable for the trigger mechanic (we use cron triggers), so the rescheduling is done on the pool thread. So random subsequent calls executed on the same pool thread might fail, because the SecurityContext is not set.
Getting DelegatingSecurityContextExecutor to set the enableOnOriginalThread property on DelegatingSecurityContextRunnable to true would fix that issue.
