Listener Container Local Transactions Not Properly Set Up.
When using local transactions (no external tx manager) and exposeListenerChannel is true (default), the synchronized resource does not have the synchronizedWithTransaction property set to true.
This causes a downstream RabbitTemplate to close() the channel.
