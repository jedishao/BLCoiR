Thread safety of ErlangTemplateErlangTemplate.executeErlangRpc is not threadsafe when used with SingleConnectionFactory.
The code in ErlangTemplate.executeErlangRpc first calls connection.sendRPC then calls connection.receiveRPC(). 
When used with the SingleConnectionFactory this means that another thread could also be using the same connection.
The end result of this is that connection.sendRPC and connection.receiveRPC() requests become interleaved.
I believe, but have not checked, that with SimpleConnectionFactory, this would not happen as each thread would have its own connection.
I understand that thread safety is not documented, so should be not assumed, so I am issuing this bug mainly to request documentation on the thread safety of the ErlangTemplate.
If ErlangTemplate is intended to be thread safe, this bug should be raised to "Critical".
