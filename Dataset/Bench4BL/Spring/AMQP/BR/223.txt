Too Many Threads Running in SimpleListenerContainerIf doStart() is called twice, we end up with two threads running in each consumer.
This can happen, say, if spring-integration-amqp declares an adapter that uses an externally defined listener container.
The container itself is started, and then started again by the adapter.
This can cause acks to go out asynchronously. Need to protect against running the consumers multiple times.
