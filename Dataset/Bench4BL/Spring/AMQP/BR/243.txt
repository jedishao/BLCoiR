AmqpAppender and log4j synchronization issues resulting in messages lossThe Log4j AmqpAppender is subject to synchronization issues because of the Log4j PatternLayout.
Problem is at the following line :
String routingKey = routingKeyLayout.format(logEvent);
We must either use another pattern like the EnhancedPatternLayoutlike suggested by the PatternLayout JavaDoc or add synchronization code.
The consequence is message lost because of the routing key badly generated.
