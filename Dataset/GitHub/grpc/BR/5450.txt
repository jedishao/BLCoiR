Data race in NameResolve.Listener.onError
NameResolve.Listener.onError can be called concurrently in different threads, so the following code in onError() impl may have data race.
if (haveBackends == null || haveBackends) {
    channelLogger.log(ChannelLogLevel.WARNING, "Failed to resolve name: {0}", error);
    haveBackends = false;
}
