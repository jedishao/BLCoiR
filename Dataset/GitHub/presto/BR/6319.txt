Fix thread safety of IndexLookup in AccumuloClient
AccumuloClient is a singleton and contains an instance of IndexLookup. It then calls setAuths() from getTabletSplits() which is called from different threads.
Additionally, IndexLookup uses ColumnCardinalityCache which has a normal HashMap without any synchronization. This code path is also called from multiple threads.
This should probably be done after #6318, since several of the classes involved store an AccumuloConfig.
