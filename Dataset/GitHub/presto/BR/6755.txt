Potential deadlock in db-backed resource group config manager.
While I was working on the reloadable file-backed resource group config manager I hit a deadlock situation, which I think also applies to the db-backed config manager unless I am missing something. \cc @elonazoulay @cberner
Assume we have these two threads:
T1  (DbResourceGroupConfigurationManager)          T2 (pool thread in ClusterMemoryManager)

configureChangedGroups()                           AbstractResourceConfigurationManager::memory_change_listener_lambda()
lock(root-group)                                   lock(generalPoolMemoryFraction)
configureGroup()                                   InternalResourceGroup::setSoftMemoryLimit()
lock(generalPoolMemoryFraction)                    lock(root-group)
