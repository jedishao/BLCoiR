Callback race on start in cachingCost balancer.
          CachingCostBalancerStrategyFactory registers callbacks in its start() method, which is problematic since any callbacks that happen between start of ServerInventoryView and BalancerStrategyFactory will be missed. Inventory view callbacks should generally be registered in constructors, not in start methods.
I discovered this when trying to test the cachingCost balancer on a cluster that has a small number of segments, and found that it missed the initialization callback (happened too fast) so it refused to create itself.
