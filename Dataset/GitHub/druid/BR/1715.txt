Zombie tasks able to acquire locks after failure.
We had an issue where disconnect somewhere occurred long enough for the overlord to log a task as failed, but the task was still running. After 45 mins or so the task submitted a lock acquire request and it was granted, but since the task had already been failed, it never was properly cleaned up.
These are from the overlord

Suffice to say, this is a long-running task that acquires multiple 1-hr locks during the course of its execution.
