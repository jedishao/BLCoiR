RedissonFairLock deadlock.
Seems related to the change on #2099.
We have tried to upgrade to 3.11.2 from 3.10.7 and this behavior started occurring.

Expected behavior

The FairLock acquired on high load system without lease time defined.

Actual behavior

Redisson does not handle the case of Fair lock without lease time (on high load).
when many different threads are asking for the same lock key the client is stuck and no thread acquires the lock.

Steps to reproduce or test case

`

    ExecutorService executorService = new ThreadPoolExecutor(0, Integer.MAX_VALUE,
            1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
            new SynchronousQueue<Runnable>());
    RedissonClient client = Redisson.create();
    IntStream.rangeClosed(0, 300).boxed().forEach(new Consumer<Integer>() {
        @Override
        public void accept(Integer integer) {
            executorService.submit(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    ConnectionManager connectionManager = Redisson.class.cast(client).getConnectionManager();
                    try {
                        Field field = MasterSlaveConnectionManager.class.getDeclaredField("id");
                        field.setAccessible(true);
                        field.set(connectionManager, UUID.randomUUID());
                    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                    RLock lock1 = client.getFairLock("fair:lock");
                    try {
                        lock1.lock();
                        Thread.sleep(50);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    } finally {
                        lock1.unlock();
                        System.out.println("done = " + integer);
                    }
                }
            });
        }
    });
    Thread.sleep(150000);`
