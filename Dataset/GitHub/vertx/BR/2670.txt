Client connections on GlobalEventExecutor thread that are not propagated to the application.
Sometimes the Netty's bootstrap may notify client connections on the GlobalEventExecutor thread when it happens early in the boostrap when an event-loop has not been yet determined.
Vertx expects notifications to happen on the event loop thread and this results in a Uh oh! Event loop context executing with wrong thread! failure.
