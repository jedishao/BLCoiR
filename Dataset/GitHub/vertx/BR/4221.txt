Pool can deliver lease with null connection.
A race can happen in the pool when it delivers a lease. Leases are created as pool post actions and sometimes can read a connection from a slot that became null in the meantime the post action is executed.

This leads in an NPE in the HttpClient that instead should not get non null closed connection, instead of a null connection. (reported here #4220 (comment))
