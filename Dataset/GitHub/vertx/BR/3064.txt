HttpServerResponse operation should not fail synchronously when the stream is is closed
We already have made some improvements here and for we should have the same behaviour for other related responses methods.

when the stream is ended (by the user) then it should fail synchronously because it is a programming mistake
when the stream is closed then it should not fail synchronously but should fail asynchronously. In Vert.x 4 the synchronous operation return a Future result that be failed in this case.
